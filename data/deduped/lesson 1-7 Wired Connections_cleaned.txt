Category 3: Four twisted wire pairs, data speeds up to 10Mbps Category 5: Improved version of Cat 3, data speeds up to 100Mbps Category 5e: Improved version of Cat 5, data speeds up to 1Gbps Category 6: Improved version of Cat5e, data speeds up to 10Gbps Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Ethernet Cabling Ethernet cabling types use the naming convention “N<base/broad>X”, where: • N=Signaling rate in Mbps • X=Identifier for the cabling scheme • <base/broad> = Base for baseband or Broad for broadband • Example: 10baseT = 10Mbps, baseband, Twisted-pair Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Coax Cabling standards • 10base5 “thicknet”: Coaxial Ethernet standard used with heavy RG-8 or RG-6 coax cabling. • The “5” represents the maximum segment length of 500m. • 10base2 “thinnet”: Coaxial Ethernet standard used with RG-58 coax cabling. • The “2” represents a theoretical maximum segment length of 200m, though 185m is more likely. • Both use 50ohm impedance and are most commonly used in bus topology networks. • Mostly obsolete.

Twisted-pair Cabling Standards • 10baseT: 10Mbps, 4 pairs (2 used), up to 100m on Cat3+ • 100baseT:100Mbps, 4 pairs (2 used), up to 100m on Cat5+ • 1000baseT: 1Gbps, 4 pairs (all used), up to 100m on Cat5e+ • 10GbaseT: 10Gbps, 4 pairs (all used), up to 100m on Cat6a Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Twisted-Pair Cabling Why the twist? • Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) on untwisted wire pairs can create more noise on the wire closer to the EMI source. • With twisted-pair cabling, EMI interference is balanced across the pair, canceling out the interference.

Fiber Optic Cabling • 100BaseFX: 100Mbps on two strands of optical fiber, up to 2km • 10GbaseSR: “short reach”, 10Gbps on single-mode fiber, up to 400m • 10GbaseER: “extended reach”, 10Gbps on single- mode fiber, up to 40km • 10GbaseSW: 10Gbps on multi-mode fiber, up to 300m (designed for SONET equipment) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Other Ethernet Standards Ethernet over Power Line: • Allows Ethernet transmission over existing power lines • Can be used by power companies to provide broadband, or used within a home or office to supply wired Ethernet to areas where it is difficult to run new cabling. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Other Ethernet Standards (contd.) • Ethernet over HDMI • In theory, it combines Ethernet signaling with audio, video, and potentially other streams on a single HDMI cable. • In practice, very few devices support Ethernet over HDMI and practical uses seem limited. • Ethernet over Power Line and Ethernet over HDMI are part of the IEEE 1905.1-2013 standard. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. IEEE • The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is a global professional association which publishes standards in areas including Power, IT, and Telecommunications. • Wiring standards including 10baseT, 10GbaseSR, etc. are from the IEEE • IEEE 1905.1-2013 is a recent standard designed to provide a common interface for technologies including Ethernet over Powerline, Ethernet over HDMI, and 802.11x wireless standards. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DOCSIS Data Over Cable Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is a broadband standard for delivering high bandwidth data over cable TV (CATV) systems. • DOCSIS 1.x and 2.x can deliver one channel of 42.88Mbps bandwidth downstream and 10 to 30Mbps upstream. • DOCSIS 3.0 added support for IPv6 and multiple bonded channels. • DOCSIS 3.1 can deliver up to 10Gbps downstream and 1Gbps upstream by using available spectrum more efficiently.
