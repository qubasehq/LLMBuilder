Lesson 3-4: Physical Security Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss the benefits of door access control, cipher lock, and mantrap. • Explain the use of a key fob. • Define biometrics. • Discuss the use of video cameras and security guards. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Let’s Get Physical • The most advanced encryption, authentication, and protection strategies are useless if an intruder can walk in and: • Pick up a backup drive • Plug an infected flash drive into the server • Connect a packet sniffer into the router • Sit down at an unprotected console and change settings. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Closets • In small offices, or in departments of larger offices, you’ll find network closets – small rooms that house networking equipment. • Security considerations: • Door locks, physical or biometric • Access and sharing Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Door Access Controls Controlling access to network closets and other secure areas can be done with: • Traditional keys • Cipher locks • Electronic keypads/locks • Proximity readers/key fobs • Biometric scanners Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Keypad/Cipher Locks A cipher lock is opened with a 4 or 5 button programmable keypad. It may be mechanical or electronic. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Proximity Readers / Key Fobs • Proximity readers read key cards or key fobs at a short distance. • A key fob is a type of security token: a small hardware device with built-in authentication mechanisms. • Can be used for doors or for authentication on a computer or terminal. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Biometrics Biometrics authentication uses personal biological data to verify identity. • Fingerprint • Retina • Facial recognition • Voice recognition Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Mantraps A mantrap, air lock, sally port or access control vestibule is a physical security access control system that allows a person into one chamber for verification. If verified, they proceed through a second door; if verification fails, they can be held while security is summoned. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Video Monitoring Video monitoring can supplement access control for security and compliance purposes. • Traditional analog CCTV cameras are being replaced by modern, remotely monitored IP cameras.

Summary • Network closets can be locked or otherwise secured to prevent physical access to networking equipment. • Cipher locks are 4 or 5 button keypads that require a code to allow entry, and can be mechanical or electronic. • Key fobs are small electronic devices that facilitates authentication at doors or when accessing equipment. • Video monitoring can supplement access control for security and compliance purposes.
