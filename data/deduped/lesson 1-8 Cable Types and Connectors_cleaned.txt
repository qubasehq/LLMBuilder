Wired Connections • There are many types of wired connections, both copper and fiber-optic, which a networking professional should be familiar with. • Our goal in this module is to review the most common types and their benefits. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Some of the most common cable types are RJ-11, RJ12, RJ-14, RJ-45, and RJ-48 • RJ stands for “Registered Jack” and describes the physical construction, wiring, and signaling of the connection • Many RJ connectors look alike and may function similarly, due to similar construction RJ Connectors Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. RJ11, RJ12, and RJ14 RJ11, RJ12, and RJ14 use 6-pin connectors • RJ11 is traditional analog “phone cable” and uses only the center two wires on the 6-pin cable • Other pins may or may not be wired but will not be used in RJ11 signaling • May be labeled “6P4C” or similar • RJ12 uses all 6 wires • RJ14 uses 4 wires Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. RJ45 and RJ48C • RJ45 cables use 8-pin connectors and 4 wire pairs • Category 3, Category 5, Category 5e, and similar wiring standards use RJ45 cables and connectors • The signal is carried on pins 1,2,3, and 6 • RJ48C is a similar 8-pin, 4 wire pair cable used in ISDN / DS1 demarc connections, with the signal carried on pins 1,2,4, and 5 • In practice RJ45 and RJ48C often use the same cables Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DB9 and DB25 Connector • DB25 Connector: 25 pin physical connection, used for RS/232 Serial Ports and Parallel Printer ports “D” refers to the shape of the connector, “B” is a size designator indicating 25 pins. ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • DB9 Connector: 9 pin physical connection, most often used with RS/232 Serial Ports on computers or routers • Technically it’s a “DE-25” connector, with D being the shape and E indicating a size of 9 pins, but DB9 is the popular designation DB9 and DB25 Connector Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. RG Cables and Connectors RG-59/U and RG- 6 are popular types of coaxial cables • Coaxial cables have two conductors: an inner wire and an outer tubular conducting shield • The coax design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) from outside sources, and also minimizes the EMI generated by the cable itself Why “RG”? RG or “Radio Guide” classifications began in World War II. The numbers are sequential, meaning “RG-6” was the 6th type of cable, which was assigned an RG designation. ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. RG-59 vs. RG-6 RG-6 is the most commonly used coaxial cable type, used for cable television. RG-6, also called RG-6/U for “general utility use”, has these characteristics: • 75 ohm impedance • 18AWG center conductor RG-59 is a thinner, cheaper alternative to RG-6, sometimes used to connect devices such as DVD players to TVs. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • RG-58, also called Thinnet, or cheapernet, was a popular cable type to carry 10base2 Ethernet signals. • RG-8 (“Thicknet”) was used to carry 10base5 Ethernet signals and is also popular in amateur radio setups. RG-58 and RG-8 Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. BNC Connectors • BNC connectors are used by older 10base2 networks, and by some video connections. • BNC stands for “Bayonet Neill-Concelman” Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Couplers • BNC couplers connect two BNC cables. • Similarly, UTP couplers connect two RJ cables. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. F Connectors • F Connectors attach to raw coax cable to create a threaded connection. The connector carries the outer “shield” signal while the center conductor of the coax cable is used as the male connector. • An F Coupler connects two coax cables with F connectors Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Blocks • 66 Block – a punch down block used to connect sets of wire in a building or office. Traditionally used for phone cabling, 66 blocks are unsuitable for data. • 110 Block – similar to the 66 block, the more modern 110 blocks are used for telephone and data cabling. Some 110 blocks are certified for up to Cat5 and Cat6 wiring. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Common Cable Types and Distances Category 3: 10Mbps, 100m Category 5: 100Mbps, 100m Category 5e: 1Gbps, up to 100m Category 6: 10Gbps, up to 55m Category 6a: 10Gbps, up to 100m Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Shielded vs. Unshielded Shielded Cable More expensive, adds EMI shielding to the cable. Unshielded Cable Most commonly used type Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Plenum Cable : More expensive than PVC, Plenum cable is fire retardant and thus suitable for the plenum spaces in buildings (where air circulates). • PVC Cable: Less expensive, more commonly used form of cabling. Sheathed in PolyVinyl-Chloride, it gives off deadly gases when burned and thus Plenum cable is sometimes required by fire codes. Plenum vs. PVC Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Straight-Through cable: wires are mapped to the same pins on both ends. (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, etc.) • Crossover cable (X designation): TX and RX lines are crossed along the cable. Crossover cables are sometimes required to connect two network devices, such as switches, to each other. • Rollover cable: wire order is exactly reversed on the opposite end.

Copper vs. Fiber • Copper: • Cheap • Flexible • Subject to EMI and RFI • Limited distance (100m maximum, typically) • Fiber Optic: • Expensive • More difficult to install • Easier to damage • Immune to EMI/RFI interference • Transmits up to 40km, harder to troubleshoot • Requires more expensive tools and equipment to install and test.
