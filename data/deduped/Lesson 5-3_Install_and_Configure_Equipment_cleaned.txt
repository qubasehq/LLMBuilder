When planning the installation of equipment, particularly at a new location, consideration has to be given to the following: • Electrical Systems – will there be sufficient electrical power and connections to supply the immediate equipment needs as well as reasonably estimated future expansion? Can better backup and surge protection needs also be accommodated? • Data Cabling – how will data cabling be run so that all connectivity needs are met and the cabling is properly terminated, organized, and labeled to make future troubleshooting easier? • Mounting and Placement – what equipment will be needed to properly and securely mount and access the cables, servers, and other devices? • Environmental Controls – when all equipment and cabling is in place, will there be sufficient air flow and cooling to ensure the equipment operates properly? Installation Considerations Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Distribution Frame A Distribution Frame is a device which terminates cables, allowing interconnections. • The Main Distribution Frame (MDF) serves to connect equipment outside the facility (incoming phone or Internet connections from an outside provider) with equipment inside the facility. • The MDF is generally the demarcation point between the LAN (internal) and the WAN (external). • Larger sites or campuses may also have Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDF), which connect cables running from the MDF with cabling to local devices in a particular building, department, or area. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Cable Management While many devices do connect wirelessly, wired connections are still the backbone of a modern network. Rather than have dozens of cables connecting directly from the data outlet to the switch at the Distribution Frame, a well-organized network will make use of Patch Panels. • Patch Panels are termination points for cabling from data outlets. Each cable terminates into a punch-down block on the back of the patch panel, connecting with a labeled port on the front. • Short Ethernet or Fiber Optic cables called Patch Cables (usually < 3ft or 1m long) are used to connect the Patch Panel and nearby switches or other devices.

Devices that aid in power management include: • Power converters –these convert power from AC to DC, convert one voltage to another, or convert one frequency to another. • Circuits – A circuit carries power from the circuit breaker to power outlets, lights, and direct-wired devices. Placing too many devices on one circuit can lead to tripped circuit breakers or dangerous overload situations. Power Management Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Power Management • UPS - Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are batteries that supply power when the line voltage fails. Some can also provide supplemental power if line voltage drops, which is a feature called brownout protection. • Inverters – Inverters convert DC current to AC current and are often used in vehicles to allow the use of AC current devices from the vehicle’s DC current electrical system. • Power redundancy – When downtime becomes a significant problem, a redundant power supply can prevent outages due to a failed power supply. Each power supply can also be tied to a different Circuit, called A+B Power or A/B Power, to prevent outages due to a circuit failure. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Air Flow • Most computers and many network devices use cooling fans to expel hot air and bring in cool air to keep their components running optimally. • If the ambient air temperature is too high, or if the ventilation ports are blocked by debris, furniture, or cables, the equipment can overheat. • Overheating can result in crashes, reboots, unexpected errors, and a shorter life span for digital equipment. • To prevent problems, adequate room for air flow should be provided around each device, including sufficient air conditioning. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Rack Systems Rack Systems hold servers, switches, and other devices in a standardized vertical arrangement. • Standard Racks are 19” wide and are measured vertically in units called Rack Units or U. One U is 1.75” tall, and rack- mounted devices are specified in U (for example, a 48-port rack-mount patch panel is often 2U, or 3.5” tall). • Freestanding Racks stand on their own without being secured to a ceiling or wall. • Server Rail Racks mount a server onto a data rack and allow it to slide out for maintenance.

Rack Monitoring and Security • Data Racks can be secured with a front door to prevent physical access. • Data Racks can also be outfitted with monitoring devices which can remotely report on the condition of the rack. • Attributes monitored can include: • Temperature • Humidity/Water • Smoke detection • Door Open Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Labeling Troubleshooting problems in the network can be a stressful task when systems are down and management is upset. The key to easier troubleshooting is organization and labeling. • Port and Patch Panel labeling – ports on routers and firewalls should be labeled, as well as the outlets or patch panels to which they connect • System labeling - labeling computer systems, especially workstations, can make it easier to keep a log of issues and track issue patterns. • Circuit labeling – when multiple power circuits are used, labeling power outlets with their corresponding circuit is critical. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Naming Conventions Before creating labels, choosing a consistent naming convention is important. • Some naming systems use words, others use numbers, some use bar codes – the format is less important than being consistent throughout the organization.

Here is a quick recap of what we have learned in this lesson. Summary • When planning the installation of equipment, particularly at a new location, consideration has to be given to the Electrical Systems, Data Cabling, Mounting and Placement, and Environmental Controls. • The Main Distribution Frame (MDF) serves to connect equipment outside the facility with equipment inside the facility. • Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are batteries that supply power when the line voltage fails. • Care should be taken to label circuits and cables in an organized manner. • Maintaining consistency in naming conventions is imperative.
