Confidentiality is about allowing authorized access to information while protecting it from improper disclosure. Personally identifiable information, protected health information, and classified/sensitive information are examples of confidential information. Sensitivity is a measure of the importance assigned to information by its owner and denotes that it needs protection. Disclosure of sensitive information could harm an organization or an individual, especially external stakeholders. 1.1.2 Integrity Integrity is the property of information that ensures its completeness , accuracy , internal consistency, and usefulnes s for a stated purpose. Integrity applies to information, data, systems or processes for business operations, organizations, and people and their actions. Data integrity ensures that data is not modified or altered in any unauthorized manner, and it covers data in storage, during processing, and while in transit. System integrit y refers to using a known good configuration and expected operational functionality as the system processes. The need to safeguard information and system integrity may be dictated by laws and regulations or the needs of the organization to access and use reliable, accurate information. 1.1.3 Availability Availability means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them. The core concept of availability is that data is accessible to authorized users when and where it is needed and in the form and format required. Critical systems and data must have appropriate levels of availability, and the security professional must consult with the involved business to identify them. Availability is often associated with the term criticality , which represents the importance an organization gives to data or an information system in performing its operations or achieving its mission. 1.1.4 Authentication It is used and necessary to validate that they are rightful owner for that identity. This process of proving user's identification is known as authentication and the common authentication methods are broken in to three divisions: Something You Know - Passwords or Passphrases. Something You Have - Tokens, smart cards, memory cards Something You are - Bio metrics, measurable characteristic There are two types of authentication: SFA (Single Factor Authentication) : Which requires the user to demonstrate any one of the authentication methods listed. MFA (Multi Factor Authentication): Which requires the user to demonstrate two or more of the authentication methods listed. Knowledge based or Something You Know methods of authentication are vulnerable to various attacks including social engineering, brute-force etc To ensure better security, a second or third method of authentication should be demonstrated to ensure the rightful owner. 1.1.5 Non-repudiation It is a legal term and is defined as the protection against an individual falsely denying performed actions. It provides the capability to determine whether a task has been performed by an individual , such as creating information, performing transactions etc. 1.1.6 Privacy It is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves. Global privacy is an especially crucial issue when considering requirements regarding the collection and security of personal information. Global privacy is an especially crucial issue when considering requirements regarding the collection and security of personal information and many more. These laws, including national- and state-level laws, dictate that any entity anywhere in the world handling the private data of people in a particular legal jurisdiction must abide by its privacy requirements. An example of a law with multinational implications is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all organizations, foreign or domestic, doing business in the EU or any persons in the EU.

1.2.1 Risk It is the measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of: The adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs. The likelihood of occurrence. Information Security Risk This reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems. It represents the risk associated with threat, likelihood and impact and IT risk is subset of business risk. Asset It is something that is in need of protection. Vulnerability It is a gap or weakness in an organization's protection of sensitive or classified assets including information, if triggered or acted upon, could cause a risk event to occur. Threat It is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. The various types of threat actors such as: - Insiders (either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence). - Outside individuals or informal groups (either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability). - Formal entities that are nonpolitical (such as business competitors and cyber criminals). - Formal entities that are political (such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists). - Intelligence or information gatherers (could be any of the above). - Technology (such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence, which could be part of any of the above). 1.2.2 Risk Identification, Assessment and Treatment Risk Identification It is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations. It is a recurring process of identifying different possible risk, characterizing them and estimating the potential for disruption of an organization. It involves looking at your unique company and analyzing its unique situation. Identify risk to communicate it clearly. Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk. Identify risk to protect against it. A risk assessment can prioritize items for management to determine the method of mitigation that best suits the assets being protected. The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s). This report is provided to management for review and approval. Risk Treatment It relates to making decisions about best actions to take regarding the identified or prioritized risk. The decision made will depend upon the attitude of the management towards the risk, availability and cost of risk mitigation Risk Avoidance It is decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk. This option is considered when the impact or likelihood of the risk is simply too high or great. Risk Acceptance Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. This option is considered when the risk and likelihood of the risk is negligible. Risk Mitigation Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Mitigation can involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk. Risk cannot always be mitigated , but mitigation such as safety measures should always be in place. Risk Transference Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party (generally Insurance Companies) . Who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy. Risk Priorities When risks have been identified, it is time to prioritize and analyze core risks through qualitative risk (A type of risk analysis where the impact of the risk is given by low,medium, high and severe) analysis and/or quantitative risk analysis (A type of risk analysis where the impact of the risk is given by numerical values). This is necessary to determine root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks. One effective method to prioritize risk is to use a risk matrix , which helps identify priority as the intersection of likelihood of occurrence and impact. It also gives the team a common language to use with management when determining the final priorities.

Security controls pertain to the physical, technical and administrative mechanisms that act as safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and its information. The implementation of controls should reduce risk, hopefully to an acceptable level . 1.3.1 Administrative Controls It is also known as managerial controls. These controls are directives, guidelines or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. They provide frameworks, constraints and standards for human behavior, and should cover the entire scope of the organization’s activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders. Administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security. These and other techniques bring the policies to a more neutral level and away from the decision-making of only the senior executives. It also makes them immediate, useful and operational on a daily and per-task basis. 1.3.2 Technical Controls It is also known as logical controls. They are security controls that computer systems and networks directly implement. These controls can provide automated protection again unauthorized access or misuse or any other threat and support security requirements for application and data. They can be configuration settings or parameters of data, or they can be hardware setting/protection like switches etc. The implementation of technical controls always requires significant operational considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization. 1.3.3 Physical Controls They follow process based security needs using physical devices like badge reader, architectural features etc. They provide ways to control and direct movement of people and equipment from physical location. Physical controls also provide protection and control over entry onto the land surrounding the buildings, parking lots or other areas that are within the organization’s control. Physical controls are supported by technical controls as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system.

For an organization to complete it's objectives requires that decisions are made, rules and practices are defined, and policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission. An organization is guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures. Relation between Regulations, Standards, Policies and Procedures Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government and typically carry financial penalties for noncompliance. Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations. Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations. Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies. 1.4.1 Policies Policy is informed by applicable law(s) and specifies which standards and guidelines the organization will follow. They are broad, but not detailed; it establishes context and sets out strategic direction and priorities. They are used to moderate and control decision-making, to ensure compliance when necessary and to guide the creation and implementation of other policies. They are implemented or carried out by people. 1.4.2 Procedures Procedures define the explicit, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. They provide supporting data, decision criteria or other explicit knowledge needed to perform each task. They establish the measurement criteria and methods to use to determine whether a task has been successfully completed. They need to properly documented on how to do something and follow them is necessary for deriving the maximum organizational benefits from procedures. 1.4.3 Standards They cover a broad range of issues and ideas and may provide assurance that an organization is operating with policies and procedures that support regulations and are widely accepted best practices. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) They develop and publish international standards on a variety of technical subjects, including information systems and information security, as well as encryption standards. ISO solicits input from the international community of experts to provide input on its standards prior to publishing. The publish documents needs to be purchased. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) They publish a variety of technical standards in addition to information technology and information security standards. Many of the standards issued by NIST are requirements for U.S. government agencies and are considered recommended standards by industries worldwide. The published documents are free to download from their website. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) They are standards in communication protocols that ensure all computers can connect with each other across borders, even when the operators do not speak the same language. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) They set standards for telecommunications, computer engineering and similar disciplines. 1.4.4 Regulations and Laws Regulations are associated fines and penalties can be imposed by governments at the national, regional or local level. As they are imposed and enforced differently in different parts of the world. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) This is the law that governs the use of protected health information (PHI) in the United States. Violation of the HIPAA rule carries the possibility of fines and/or imprisonment for both individuals and companies. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) This was enacted by the European Union (EU) to control use of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of its citizens and those in the EU. It includes provisions that apply financial penalties to companies who handle data of EU citizens and those living in the EU even if the company does not have a physical presence in the EU, giving this regulation an international reach.

1.5.1 Professional Code of Ethics ISC2 Code of Ethics Preamble It states the purpose and intent of the ISC2 Code of Ethics. The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other, requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior. Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification. ISC2 Code of Ethics Canons They represent the important beliefs held in common by the members of ISC2. Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure. Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally. Provide diligent and competent service to principals. Advance and protect the profession.

It is planning an likely incident which may cause disruption to an organization business. Terminologies Breach The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information; or an authorized user accesses personally identifiable information for other than an authorized purpose. Event Any observable occurrence in a network or a system. Exploit A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities. Incident An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores or transmits. Intrusion A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization. Threat Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service. Vulnerability Weakness in an information system , system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. Zero Day A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods. 2.1.1 Purpose The priority of any incident response is to protect life, health and safety . When any decision related to priorities is to be made, always choose safety first . The primary goal of incident management is to be prepared. An event is any measurable occurrence, and most events are harmless. However, if the event has the potential to disrupt the business’s mission, then it is called an incident. 2.2.2 Importance It is important because it helps preserve business viability and survival. It is aimed at reducing the impact of an incident so the organization can resume its operations as soon as possible. 2.2.3 Components An incident response policy should reference an incident response plan that employees follow, depending on the role in the organization. It contain several procedures and standards related to incident response. Procedures to implement the plan should define the technical processes, techniques, checklists and other tools that teams will use when responding to an incident. Preparation Develop a policy approved by management. Identify critical data and systems, single points of failure. Train staff on incident response. Implement an incident response team. (covered in subsequent topic) Practice Incident Identification. (First Response) Identify Roles and Responsibilities. Plan the coordination of communication between stakeholders. Consider the possibility that a primary method of communication may not be available. Detection and Analysis Monitor all possible attack vectors. Analyze incident using known data and threat intelligence. Prioritize incident response. Standardize incident documentation Containment Gather evidence. Choose an appropriate containment strategy. Identify the attacker. Isolate the attack. Post-Incident Activity Identify evidence that may need to be retained. Document lessons learned. Incident Response Team Organization establish security operating center with incident report team. A typical incident response team is a cross-functional group of individuals who represent the management, technical and functional areas of responsibility most directly impacted by a security incident. Potential team members include the following: Representative(s) of senior management Information security professionals Legal representatives Public affairs/communications representatives Engineering representatives (system and network) They assist with investigating the incident, assessing the damage, collecting evidence, reporting the incident and initiating recovery procedures. They also participate in the remediation and lessons learned stages and help with root cause analysis. These teams are commonly known as computer incident response teams (CIRTs) or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). Primary responsibilities of an SOC: Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident. Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident. Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage. Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.

It is maintaining critical business functions such as communications and technology when an disruption occurs. 2.2.1 Purpose The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption . A key part of the plan is communication, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Organizations will go through their procedures and checklists to make sure they know exactly who is responsible for which action. 2.2.2 Importance The importance of a business continuity plan for organizations is to have a plan in place to maintain their operations during disruptions, whether caused by natural disasters, cyberattacks, or other unforeseen events. It help the organizations in the following way: Minimize financial losses Maintain customer trust and loyalty Ensure employee safety and well-being Comply with legal and regulatory requirements Protect their reputation and brand image Without a business continuity plan, organizations may struggle to recover from disruptions and suffer severe consequences. Therefore, it is essential to invest time and resources in creating and regularly updating a comprehensive and effective plan. 2.2.3 Components Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization. Red Book is an outlined document containing the business continuity plan. Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is an analysis of information system's requirements, functions and inter dependencies used to assume a future event requirements and priorities in an disruption.. Some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan: List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.) Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers How/when to enact the plan Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)

This comes right after Business Continuity which maintains the operation of critical business functions. Whereas, Disaster Recovery is about recovering everything back to full operation. Disaster Recovery plans include backing up data at a server level, it is also necessary to consider the database itself, as well as any dependencies on other systems. 2.3.1 Purpose The Disaster recovery plan (DRP) guides the actions of emergency response personnel until the end goal is reached. Which is to see the business restored to full last-known reliable operations. Disaster recovery refers specifically to restoring the information technology and communications services and systems needed by an organization, both during the period of disruption caused by any event and during restoration of normal services. 2.3.2 Importance The importance of disaster recovery is to: Get the normal business operations running in an organization. Reduce downtime caused due to business continuity operations etc. 2.3.3 Components Organizations maintain documents intended for different audience. Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan Department-specific plans Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members Checklists for certain individuals:

Subject A subject can be defined as any entity that requests access to our assets. A subject: - Is a user, a process, a procedure, a client (or a server), a program, a device such as an endpoint, workstation, smartphone or removable storage device with onboard firmware. - Is active: It initiates a request for access to resources or services. - Requests a service from an object. - Should have a level of clearance (permissions) that relates to its ability to successfully access services or resources. Object Anything that a subject attempts to access is referred to as an object. An object:- Access control includes various permissions such as system access, building access, access to server rooms, access to networks, applications, and utilities. - These implementations of access control form part of a layered defense strategy known as defense in depth. - Defense in depth is an information security strategy that integrates people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of an organization. - It employs multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to achieve security objectives. - While defense in depth aims to prevent or deter cyberattacks, it cannot guarantee that an attack will not occur. - Is a building, a computer, a file, a database, a printer or scanner, a server, a communications resource, a block of memory, an input/output port, a person, a software task, thread or process. - Is anything that provides service to a user. - Is passive. - Responds to a request. - May have a classification. Access Rule An access rule is an instruction developed to allow or deny access to an object by comparing the validated identity of the subject to an access control list. The rule will contain or reference a set of attributes that define what level of access has been determined to be appropriate. A rule can: - Compare multiple attributes to determine appropriate access. - Allow access to an object. - Define how much access is allowed. - Deny access to an object. - Apply time-based access. Defense In Depth Access control includes various permissions such as system access, building access, access to server rooms, access to networks, applications, and utilities. These implementations of access control form part of a layered defense strategy known as defense in depth. Defense in depth is an information security strategy that integrates people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of an organization. It employs multiple countermeasures in a layered fashion to achieve security objectives. While defense in depth aims to prevent or deter cyber attacks, it cannot guarantee that an attack will not occur. Least Privilege The Principle of Least Privilege is a standard that advocates granting users or programs only the minimum access necessary to fulfill their functions. Users are given access only to the systems and programs required for performing their specific job or tasks. Privilege Access Management Privileged access management is used to preserve the confidentiality of information and ensure that only authorized personnel can access it, based on the principle of least privilege. Each user is granted access only to the specific items they need and nothing more. For example, in a billing department, only authorized individuals can view consumer financial data, and even fewer have the authority to modify or delete such data, maintaining confidentiality and integrity. Administrative access is provided with appropriate passwords or sign-ins to verify users' permissions for accessing the data. Temporary or limited access may be granted for specific time periods or within business hours, and access rules can restrict the fields individuals can access. In a healthcare environment, access to patient data might be limited based on specific roles and responsibilities. This is often regulated by laws like HIPAA in the United States and privacy laws in other countries. Systems monitor access to private information, triggering alarms if unauthorized access is detected. Security administrators record incidents and alert appropriate personnel for action. The level of security around access increases with the criticality of the information, including implementing multi-factor authentication for higher-level access. Privileged Accounts Privileged accounts have permissions beyond those of normal users, typically used by managers and administrators. Various classes of users utilize privileged accounts, including: Systems administrators, responsible for operating systems, application deployment, and performance management. Help desk or IT support staff, who require privileged access to endpoints, servers, and applications platforms for support tasks. Security analysts, needing rapid access to the entire IT infrastructure and data environment of the organization. Additional privileged user accounts may be created for specific projects or clients, granting greater control over data and applications. Delegating the management and protection of information assets to trusted managerial, supervisory, or leadership personnel is common, but contingent on trustworthiness to avoid potential harm to the organization and stakeholders. Measures for Moderating Privileged Account Risks: Extensive Logging: Privileged actions are extensively logged to serve as a deterrent and for administrative control, enabling audits and detection of malicious activity. Stringent Access Control: Privileged users are required to undergo more rigorous authentication, and just-in-time identity can restrict privileges to specific tasks and times. Deeper Trust Verification: Privileged account holders undergo detailed background checks, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use policies, and may be subject to financial investigation. Enhanced Auditing: Privileged account activity is monitored and audited at a higher rate and extent than regular user accounts. Segregation of Duties A core element of authorization is the principle of segregation of duties (also known as separation of duties). Segregation of duties is based on the security practice that no one person should control an entire high-risk transaction from start to finish. Segregation of duties breaks the transaction into separate parts and requires a different person to execute each part of the transaction. For example, an employee may submit an invoice for payment to a vendor (or for reimbursement to themselves), but it must be approved by a manager prior to payment. In another instance, almost anyone may submit a proposal for a change to a system configuration, but the request must go through technical and management review and gain approval before implementation. These steps can prevent fraud or detect errors in the process before implementation. When two individuals can willfully work together to bypass the segregation of duties, so that they could jointly commit fraud. This is called collusion. Two-Person Integrity The two-person rule is a security strategy that requires a minimum of two people to be in an area together, making it impossible for a person to be in the area alone. Many access control systems prevent an individual cardholder from entering a selected high-security area unless accompanied by at least one other person. Use of the two-person rule can help reduce insider threats to critical areas by requiring at least two individuals to be present at any time. It is also used for life safety within a security area; if one person has a medical emergency, there will be assistance present.

A control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data. This, of course, is the CIA Triad. A control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data (CIA Triad). Access control involves limiting what objects can be available to what subjects according to what rules. One brief example of a control is a firewall, which is included in a system or network to prevent external disturbances or compromises. Physical access controls are tangible measures designed to prevent, monitor, or detect direct contact with systems or areas within a facility but also to protect the health and safety of the personnel inside. They include: Security guards Fences Motion detectors Locked doors/gates Sealed windows Lights Cable protection Laptop locks Badges Swipe cards Guard dogs Cameras Man traps/turnstiles Alarms Physical access controls are crucial for safeguarding a company's assets, especially its most important asset - its people. When implementing physical access controls, the security and safety of personnel take top priority, followed by securing other physical assets. 3.1.1 Physical Security Controls Physical security controls for human traffic are often implemented using various technologies, such as: Turnstiles Man traps Remotely or system-controlled door locks Access Control System and Enrollment To identify an authorized employee, an access control system requires an enrollment station to assign and activate an access control device. Most often, a badge is produced and issued with the employee's identifiers, granting access to specific areas. In high-security environments, enrollment may include bio-metric characteristics. The access control system compares an individual's badge against a verified database to authenticate the person. If authenticated, the access control system sends output signals allowing authorized personnel to pass through gates or doors to controlled areas. The systems are typically integrated with the organization's logging systems to document access activity, both authorized and unauthorized. Types of Access Control Cards A range of card types allows the system to be used in different environments. These cards include: Bar code Magnetic stripe Proximity Smart Hybrid 3.1.2 Monitoring The use of physical access controls and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving as well as auditing/logging all physical events are primary elements in maintaining overall organizational security. Cameras Cameras are integrated into the security program and centrally monitored, providing surveillance and deterrence. They can detect activities when combined with other sensors and provide valuable evidence if recorded. Motion sensor technologies augment their capabilities for monitoring the external perimeter. Properly integrated exterior sensors alert organizations to potential intruders. Logs Physical logs are records of events that have occurred, such as sign-in sheets maintained by security guards or logs from electronic systems managing physical access. Physical security logs are essential for supporting business requirements, compliance with regulations, and forensic investigations. Logs must be protected from manipulation and unauthorized disclosure, especially if they contain sensitive data about customers or users. Organizations should establish guidelines for log retention and regularly review logs as part of their security program. Identifying log anomalies is crucial for detecting security-related issues during audits and routine monitoring. Different economies, countries, and industries may have varying business and legal requirements for log retention. The legal department should be consulted to determine the appropriate log retention period if there are no specific business or legal requirements. Security Guards Security guards are a highly effective physical security control. Regardless of the type of physical access control used, the presence of security guards or monitoring systems serves as a deterrent. Security guards discourage individuals from attempting to masquerade as someone else or tailgating closely behind authorized personnel to gain unauthorized access. Their presence helps prevent theft and abuse of equipment or sensitive information. Alarm Systems Alarm systems are commonly used on doors and windows in homes and office buildings. They are designed to alert appropriate personnel when a door or window is opened unexpectedly. For authorized access, employees may use codes or badges without triggering an alarm. Unauthorized access, such as brute force entry, will activate the alarm. Fire alarm systems are another type of alarm, activated by heat or smoke, sounding an audible warning and notifying local response personnel and fire departments. Panic buttons are used to alert police or security personnel when activated in emergency situations.

Logical access controls are electronic methods that restrict access to systems and sometimes tangible assets or areas. These controls include passwords, bio metrics implemented on devices like smartphones or laptops, and badge/token readers connected to systems. The purpose of these electronic tools is to limit access to assets even if the person already has physical access to the area. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) DAC is a type of access control policy used in information systems. It allows users with access to information to: Share that information with others. Give similar access rights to other users. Change security settings on various items in the system. Decide the security settings for new or changed items. Modify access control rules (but not always). Most systems use DAC, so users can share files and give access to others, similar to how the original owner can. Rule-based access control systems often use DAC as a basis. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy is enforced uniformly across all subjects and objects in an information system. Only trusted security administrators can modify security rules for subjects and objects. Subjects are assigned a subset of privileges for a subset of objects, limiting what they can do. Subjects cannot pass information to unauthorized subjects or objects, grant privileges to others, change security attributes, or modify access control rules. The primary difference between MAC and DAC is that in MAC, security administrators control access rights, while in DAC, it's up to the object owner's discretion. The Security rules are decided by the security administrators. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Role-based access control provides each worker privileges based on their role in the organization. Only Human Resources staff have access to personnel files; only Finance has access to bank accounts; and each manager has access to their own direct reports and department. Very high-level system administrators may have access to everything, while new employees have limited access, just the minimum required for their jobs. Monitoring role-based permissions is crucial to prevent privilege creep or permissions creep. Privilege creep occurs when a person's permissions are expanded for a specific reason, but they are not reverted when no longer needed. Having multiple roles with different permissions requires close monitoring to ensure everyone has the necessary access. Jobs being ever-changing can make it challenging to keep track of roles and permissions. Extremely granular roles and permissions add complexity to the monitoring process. A best practice is to create standard roles and create new users based on those standards, avoiding copying user profiles directly. Podcast Summary Access control is the process of permitting or restricting access to applications or data at a granular level. In an organizational setting, access control can be challenging due to human connections and the need to balance access with security. Role-based access control (RBAC) provides access privileges based on an employee's role in the organization. Separation of duties is crucial in preventing unintentional or intentional insider threats. Building good partnerships with HR and other departments can help in defining roles and access control. Connecting people and processes is essential for effective access control, and it goes beyond just technical solutions.

Networking Networking is the process of connecting two or more computers to share data, information, or resources securely. Networks involve various technologies, including hardware, software, protocols, and encryption, which enable computer communications. Types of Networks There are two main types of networks: Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). LAN covers a limited geographical area, typically within a single floor or building. WAN, on the other hand, refers to long-distance connections between geographically remote networks. Network Devices Hubs Hubs are networking devices used to connect multiple devices in a network. They are less common in business or corporate networks and are more commonly found in home networks. Hubs are wired devices and are considered less intelligent compared to switches or routers. Switch Switches, also known as intelligent hubs, are an alternative to hubs for connecting multiple devices in a network. Unlike hubs, switches are wired devices that have knowledge of the addresses of connected devices, allowing them to route traffic directly to the intended port/device instead of broadcasting to all devices. Switches offer greater efficiency in traffic delivery and improve overall data throughput compared to hubs. Although switches are smarter than hubs, they are not as intelligent as routers. Switches can also create separate broadcast domains when used to create Virtual LANs (VLANs), a topic that will be discussed later. Routers Routers are essentied to the frames, creating packets with destination addreal devices used to control traffic flow on networks and connect different networks, enabling efficient data transfer between them. They can be both wired and wireless, providing flexibility in network connectivity options. Routers are smarter than hubs and switches because they have the ability to determine the most efficient path or "route" for traffic to flow across the network. By analyzing network addresses and using routing protocols, routers ensure data reaches its intended destination using the most optimal path. Routers are crucial for directing data packets across large networks or the internet, allowing data to traverse multiple networks to reach its final destination. Firewalls Firewalls are critical tools for managing and controlling network traffic, playing a key role in network security. A firewall is a network device designed to filter and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic between a private network (e.g., an organization's internal network) and the internet, or even between different segmented networks within an organization. The primary function of a firewall is to enforce a set of predefined rules, filters, or access control lists that determine which network packets are allowed to pass through and which are blocked. By analyzing the source and destination addresses, ports, and protocols of network packets, the firewall can make decisions on whether to permit or deny the traffic based on the established rules. Firewalls are crucial in protecting networks from unauthorized access, malware, and other potential security threats by acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. Server Servers are specialized computers providing services to other computers on a network. Types of servers: web, email, print, database, and file servers. Servers are networked devices interacted with by clients. Servers have strict security measures due to sensitive data. Security measures include access controls, updates, firewalls, encryption, and monitoring. Proper server security is crucial for safeguarding data and ensuring resource availability. Endpoints Endpoints are the ends of a network communication link. One end is often at a server where a resource resides. The other end is often a client making a request to use a network resource. Endpoints can be servers, desktop workstations, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, or any other user device. Ethernet Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connections of networked devices. This standard defines the way data is formatted over the wire to ensure disparate devices can communicate over the same cables. Device Addresses Media Access Control (MAC) - Every network device is assigned a Media Access Control (MAC) address. An example is 00-13-02-1F-58-F5 . The first 3 bytes of the address denote the vendor or manufacturer of the physical network interface. Internet Protocol (IP) Address - This logical IP address represents the network interface within the network and can be useful to maintain communications when a physical device is swapped with new hardware. Examples are 192.168.1.1 (IPv4) and 2001:db8::ffff:0:1. (IPv6). Network Diagram Of A SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network Network Diagram Of A Home Network Networking Models Various models, architectures, and standards exist to connect hardware and software systems for sharing information and coordinating tasks. For Example OSI Model and TCP/IP Model. Computers and networks combine communication devices, storage devices, processing devices, security devices, input/output devices, operating systems, software, services, data, and people. To create secure and effective network systems, it's essential to prioritize the exchange of information and ideas between people and organizations to accomplish tasks. Network and security objectives can be expressed as: Providing reliable, managed communications between hosts and users. Implementing layered isolation of functions. Using packets for communication. Standardizing routing, addressing, and control. Allowing additional functionality from layers beyond inter networking. Being vendor-agnostic, scalable, and resilient. A Network Model layers Can Be Simplified Into Two Prominent Layers: Upper Layer The upper layer, also called the host or application layer, manages connection integrity and controls communication sessions between computers. It handles the establishment, maintenance, and termination of communication sessions. The upper layer transforms data received from the Application Layer into a universal format for all systems to understand. It enables applications to communicate and checks if a remote communication partner is available and accessible. Lower Layer The lower layer, also known as the media or transport layer, receives bits from the physical connection medium and converts them into frames. Frames are standardized groupings of data, similar to buckets containing water. Route data is added to the frames, creating packets with destination addresses. Once the data is organized into packets, the host layer takes over to manage further communication. Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model The OSI Model is a standardized framework used to describe the communication structure for interconnected computer systems. It provides a common way to understand how protocols function and interact in an ideal communication environment. The model is a conceptual reference and does not directly correspond to specific hardware or software implementations. The OSI Model consists of seven distinct layers, each responsible for specific tasks and functions that facilitate data exchange between two computers. These layers are often referred to by their names or layer numbers. For example, Layer 3 is known as the Network Layer. The Seven Layers of the OSI Model: Physical Layer (Layer 1): This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium. It converts data into binary signals and transmits them over physical media, such as copper cables or fiber optics. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): The Data Link Layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames between two devices directly connected on the same network segment. It provides error detection and correction and ensures proper flow control. Network Layer (Layer 3): The Network Layer handles the routing of data packets between different networks. It determines the best path for data transmission, taking into account factors like network topology, congestion, and addressing. Transport Layer (Layer 4): The Transport Layer ensures the reliable delivery of data between two endpoints. It breaks the data into smaller segments and manages flow control and error recovery. Notable protocols at this layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Session Layer (Layer 5): The Session Layer establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions (connections) between applications on different devices. It manages the communication channels, allowing data exchange between applications. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): The Presentation Layer is responsible for data translation and formatting. It converts data into a format that the application layer can understand and handles tasks like data encryption and compression. Application Layer (Layer 7): The Application Layer is the topmost layer and interacts directly with the end-user applications. It provides network services to applications, such as email, web browsing, and file transfer. Encapsulation and De-encapsulation: As data travels down the OSI Model from the Application Layer to the Physical Layer, each layer adds its own header, payload, and possibly footer (trailer) to the data. This process is known as encapsulation. The payload of one layer becomes the data for the layer below it. When data travels up the OSI Model from the Physical Layer to the Application Layer, the layers remove their respective headers and footers through a process called de-encapsulation (or decapsulation). The data unit size decreases as it moves up the layers. Examples of Networking Terminology Mapped to OSI Model: Image files like JPEG or PNG are discussed in the Presentation Layer (Layer 6). Logical ports like FTP are associated with the Session Layer (Layer 5). TCP/UDP protocols are discussed in the Transport Layer (Layer 4). Routers sending packets relate to the Network Layer (Layer 3). Switches, bridges, or WAPs sending frames are related to the Data Link Layer (Layer 2). TCP/IP Model Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is one of the most widely used protocol suites for networking and communication on the internet. It was built to replace the OSI Model . TCP/IP Protocol Architecture Layers: Application Layer: Defines the protocols used for communication between applications or software running on different devices. Transport Layer: Responsible for the reliable and orderly movement of data between devices. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and without errors. Internet Layer: Handles the addressing and routing of data packets across the network. It inserts the data packets into the appropriate paths for delivery. Network Interface Layer: This layer is concerned with how data physically moves through the network. It deals with hardware-level communication, such as sending and receiving data over network cables. TCP/IP can work on different operating systems and devices. However, this versatility comes with a drawback—TCP/IP can consume significant resources, and its original design prioritized ease of use over security, making it relatively susceptible to hacking attempts. Despite its security challenges, TCP/IP's widespread adoption has made it a fundamental component of modern networking and internet communication. IPv4 IPv4 is one of the major versions of the Internet Protocol used worldwide. It provides a 32-bit address space, which was predicted to be exhausted by the late 1980 s due to the increasing number of devices connected to the internet. To address the limited address space, IPv4 was sub-divided into public and private address ranges. The private IPv4 address ranges available for anyone to use are: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.254 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.254 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.254 IPv4 addresses are expressed as four octets separated by dots (e.g., 216.12.146.140), with each octet ranging from 0 to 255. An IPv4 address is divided into the network number and the host address. The network number is assigned by external organizations like ICANN and represents the organization's network. The host address represents the network interface within the network. To facilitate network administration, networks are divided into subnets using subnet masks (e.g., 255.255.255.0). The subnet mask specifies the subnet portion of an address, allowing efficient address allocation. Private addressing in IPv4 enables local networks, like small office, home office (SOHO) situations, to reuse addresses without conflicts. One special IPv4 address is 127.0.0.1, known as the loop-back address, used for self-diagnosis and troubleshooting at the machine level. IPv6 IPv6 is a newer version of the Internet Protocol used for identifying devices on the internet. IPv6 addresses are much longer than the older IPv4 addresses, with 128 bits compared to 32 bits, allowing for a huge number of unique addresses. An IPv6 address is written as 8 groups of four characters, where each character can be any number from 0 to 9 or a letter from A to F. The groups are separated by colons. For example, an IPv6 address could look like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 . To make long addresses easier to read, leading zeros in each group can be omitted, and consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced with double colons ( :: ). For instance, the previous example could be shortened to: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 . IPv6 addresses have special uses too, like ::1 , which is equivalent to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 and is used for testing the network interface locally. Some ranges, such as 2001:db8:: to 2001:db8:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff , are reserved for documentation and examples to avoid conflicts with real-world addresses. There are also private address ranges ( fc00:: to fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff ) meant for internal network use that are not accessible from the public internet. IPv6 is a modernization of IPv4, which addressed a number of weaknesses in the IPv4 environment: A much larger address field: IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, which supports 2128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 hosts. This ensures that we will not run out of addresses. Improved security: IPsec is an optional part of IPv4 networks, but a mandatory component of IPv6 networks. This will help ensure the integrity and confidentiality of IP packets and allow communicating partners to authenticate with each other. Improved quality of service (QoS): This will help services obtain an appropriate share of a network’s bandwidth. WiFi Wireless networking is popular for connecting corporate and home systems due to easy deployment and cost-effectiveness. It offers greater versatility as workstations and portable devices can move freely within the signal range of wireless access points. However, this freedom comes with additional security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi range is generally adequate for most homes or small offices, but range extenders can be used to expand coverage for larger areas. Wi-Fi standards have evolved over time, with each version offering faster performance. In a LAN, wired network intrusions require physical access to the network media, while wireless media intrusions can occur at a distance, potentially making them more susceptible to unauthorized access. Security Of The Network Improperly Implemented TCP/IP Stacks: Various operating systems with poorly implemented TCP/IP stacks are susceptible to different types of attacks, including DoS/DDoS attacks, fragment attacks, oversized packet attacks, spoofing attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. DoS/DDoS Attacks: TCP/IP vulnerabilities can be exploited for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where attackers flood the target system with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing service disruptions. Fragment Attacks: Attackers can manipulate IP packet fragments to confuse or overload the target system, leading to potential security breaches. Oversized Packet Attacks: Sending abnormally large packets to the target can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP stack, causing it to crash or behave unexpectedly. Spoofing Attacks: TCP/IP is susceptible to spoofing attacks, where attackers forge the source IP address to appear as a trusted entity, enabling them to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties, gaining access to sensitive data. Passive Attacks via Monitoring or Sniffing: TCP/IP, like most protocols, is susceptible to passive attacks through network monitoring or sniffing. Attackers can capture and analyze network traffic to gather information about the network, including sensitive data. 4.1.2 Ports Physical Ports : Physical ports are the ports on the routers, switches, servers, computers, etc. that you connect the wires, e.g., fiber optic cables, Cat5 cables, etc., to create a network. Logical Ports : A logical port is also known as a socket. Its a number that both the subject and object agree upon to communicate. They enable a single IP address to e multiple simultaneous communications using different port numbers. There are three categories of ports based on their numbering: Well-known ports (0–1023): These ports are associated with common protocols at the core of the TCP/IP model, such as Domain Name Service (DNS) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Registered ports (1024–49151): These ports are usually linked to proprietary applications from vendors and developers. While officially approved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), some vendors choose ports at their discretion. Examples include Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) authentication, Microsoft SQL Server, and the Docker REST API. Dynamic or private ports (49152–65535): When services associated with well-known or registered ports are requested, they respond with dynamic ports used for that session and then released. Secure Ports Some network protocols transfer data in clear text format i.e. without any kind of encryption or encoding. This can lead to breach in confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitting across ports. Network sniffing could also reveal the content of documents and other files if they are sent via insecure protocols. Common Ports and Their Secure Alternatives Insecure Port Description Protocol Secure Alternative Port Protocol 21 FTP Port 21, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sends the username and password using plaintext from the client to the server. This could be intercepted by an attacker and later used to retrieve confidential information from the server. The secure alternative, SFTP, on port 22 uses encryption to protect the user credentials and packets of data being transferred. File Transfer Protocol 22* - SFTP 23 Telnet Port 23, telnet, is used by many Linux systems and any other systems as a basic text-based terminal. All information to and from the host on a telnet connection is sent in plaintext and can be intercepted by an attacker. This includes username and password as well as all information that is being presented on the screen, since this interface is all text. Secure Shell (SSH) on port 22 uses encryption to ensure that traffic between the host and terminal is not sent in a plaintext format. Telnet 22* - SSH 37 Time Port 37, Time Protocol, may be in use by legacy equipment and has mostly been replaced by using port 123 for Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP on port 123 offers better error-handling capabilities, which reduces the likelihood of unexpected errors. Time Protocol 123 - NTP 53 DNS Port 53, Domain Name Service (DNS), is still used widely. However, using DNS over TLS (DoT) on port 853 protects DNS information from being modified in transit. Domain Name Service 853 - DoT 80 HTTP Port 80, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basis of nearly all web browser traffic on the internet. Information sent via HTTP is not encrypted and is susceptible to sniffing attacks. HTTPS using TLS encryption is preferred, as it protects the data in transit between the server and the browser. Note that this is often notated as SSL/TLS. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) has been compromised is no longer considered secure. It is now recommended for web servers and clients to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 or higher for the best protection. HyperText Transfer Protocol 443 - HTTPS 143 IMAP Port 143, Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a protocol used for retrieving emails. IMAP traffic on port 143 is not encrypted and susceptible to network sniffing. The secure alternative is to use port 993 for IMAP, which adds SSL/TLS security to encrypt the data between the mail client and the mail server. Internet Message Access Protocol 993 - IMAP 161/162 SNMP Ports 161 and 162, Simple Network Management Protocol, are commonly used to send and receive data used for managing infrastructure devices. Because sensitive information is often included in these messages, it is recommended to use SNMP version 2 or 3 (abbreviated SNMPv2 or SNMPv3) to include encryption and additional security features. Unlike many others discussed here, all versions of SNMP use the same ports, so there is not a definitive secure and insecure pairing. Additional context will be needed to determine if information on ports 161 and 162 is secured or not. Simple Network Management Protocol 161/162 - SNMP 445 SMB Port 445, Server Message Block (SMB), is used by many versions of Windows for accessing files over the network. Files are transmitted unencrypted, and many vulnerabilities are well-known. Therefore, it is recommended that traffic on port 445 should not be allowed to pass through a firewall at the network perimeter. A more secure alternative is port 2049, Network File System (NFS). Although NFS can use encryption, it is recommended that NFS not be allowed through firewalls either. Server Message Block 2049 - NFS 389 LDAP Port 389, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), is used to communicate directory information from servers to clients. This can be an address book for email or usernames for logins. The LDAP protocol also allows records in the directory to be updated, introducing additional risk. Since LDAP is not encrypted, it is susceptible to sniffing and manipulation attacks. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure (LDAPS) adds SSL/TLS security to protect the information while it is in transit. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 636 - LDAPS 4.1.3 Applications The Three-Way Handshake SYN : The "SYN" (Synchronize) is the first step in the TCP three-way handshake process. When a client initiates a connection to a server, it sends a SYN packet to the server indicating its intention to establish a connection. ACK : The "ACK" (Acknowledgment) is the second step in the TCP three-way handshake. Upon receiving the SYN packet from the client, the server responds with an ACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the client's SYN packet. SYN-ACK : The "SYN-ACK" is the third step in the TCP three-way handshake. In response to the server's ACK packet, the client sends back a SYN-ACK packet to confirm the server's acknowledgment. Connection Established : Once the server receives the SYN-ACK packet from the client, the TCP three-way handshake is complete. The connection is now established between the client and the server, and they can begin data transmission. The SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK handshake is a critical process in TCP connections, ensuring that both the client and server agree to establish a reliable and synchronized connection before exchanging data. This handshake is fundamental to reliable data transmission and is used in various network communication protocols.

Podcast Summary Host and Guest: Chad Kliewer, holder of CISSP and CCSP certifications, and Joe Sullivan, CISSP, former CISO in the banking and finance industry, specialized in forensics, incident response, and recovery. Focus: The discussion centers on cyberattacks, their impact on businesses, and methods to prevent and detect them. SIEM for Actionable Intelligence: The use of Security Information Event Management (SIEM) systems is emphasized for detecting potential threats and indicators of compromise before actual breaches occur. Properly optimized SIEMs can pick up on activities like scanning, malicious email attachments, and web application enumeration, enabling early incident response actions. Cloud-Based Attacks: Cloud-based attacks present different challenges, including diverse threat surfaces and unique threat models. Cloud-based SIEMs or third-party services can still be used to detect and respond to attacks in the cloud environment. Supply Chain Attacks: The SolarWinds attack is discussed as a significant supply chain attack. Malicious code was embedded within a software update package, and the attackers utilized multiple cloud providers to evade detection. Threat Hunting vs. Pen Testing: The differences between threat hunting, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning are explained. Threat hunting involves proactively looking for indicators of compromise and shortening the attack dwell time, while penetration testing aims to assess network vulnerabilities and improve security measures. PCI DSS: The T.J. Maxx incident is mentioned as one of the events that led to the development of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). PCI DSS is not a law but a contractual obligation between organizations and credit card companies to protect credit card data and maintain secure practices. Overall, the discussion stresses the importance of implementing fundamental security practices, such as asset inventory, network segmentation, logging, monitoring, patch management, and vulnerability scanning, to protect against cyberattacks and data breaches. (Summarized from Transcription by ChatGPT) Types Of Threats Threat Type Definition Spoofing An attack using falsified identity to gain access to a target system. Phishing An attack that misdirects legitimate users to malicious websites through deceptive emails or URLs. Denial-of-Service (DoS) A network resource consumption attack aimed at preventing legitimate activity on a victimized system. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) A DoS attack involving numerous unsuspecting secondary victim systems to overwhelm the target . Computer Virus Self-replicating code that spreads without user consent and aims to propagate and destroy data on systems. Worms Malicious code that self-propagates without human intervention , posing a risk to network security. Trojan A seemingly harmless software program carrying a hidden malicious payload , causing damage or data theft. On-Path or Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attackers position themselves between devices to intercept or modify information intended for endpoints. Side-Channel Attacks Passive, noninvasive attacks observing device operation through methods like power monitoring or timing. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Highly sophisticated and organized attacks demonstrating technical and operational skill over an extended period. Insider Threats Threats arising from trusted individuals within the organization , potentially due to disgruntlement or espionage. Malware Programs inserted into systems, compromising data , applications, or the operating system for malicious purposes. Ransomware Malware facilitating ransom attacks by encrypting files on the victim's computer and demanding payment for decryption. Steps to Protect Networks There is no silver bullet in cyber security that can protect against all types of attacks. However, there are fundamental steps that can be taken to improve network security and provide a solid base of defense against a multitude of cyber threats. Here are a few examples: Disable Unnecessary Services and Protocols If a system doesn’t need a particular service or protocol, it should not be running. Attackers cannot exploit a vulnerability in a service or protocol that isn’t running on a system. Use Firewalls Firewalls can prevent many types of attacks. There are two main types of firewalls: Network-based firewalls protect entire networks. Host-based firewalls protect individual systems. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) An intrusion occurs when an attacker bypasses or subverts security mechanisms and gains access to an organization’s resources. Intrusion detection involves monitoring recorded information and real-time events to identify abnormal activity that suggests a potential incident or intrusion. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) automates the examination of logs and real-time system events to identify intrusion attempts and system failures. Role of IDS IDS forms part of a multi-layered security strategy, complementing other security mechanisms such as firewalls. IDS can recognize attacks from external sources, like the internet, and internal threats like a malicious worm. Once a suspicious event is detected, IDS responds by sending alerts or raising alarms. The primary goal of an IDS is to facilitate a timely and accurate response to intrusions. Types of IDS Intrusion detection systems are generally classified into two types: Host-Based IDS (HIDS) It monitors elements such as process calls and information recorded in system, application, security, and host-based firewall logs. It can examine events in greater detail compared to a Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), allowing it to identify specific files that may be compromised during an attack. It can also track the processes employed by an attacker. Advantages A HIDS can detect anomalies on the host system that a NIDS might miss. For example, it can detect infections where an intruder has infiltrated a system and is controlling it remotely. Disadvantages HIDSs are more costly to manage than NIDSs because they require individual administration on each system, whereas NIDSs typically support centralized administration. A HIDS cannot detect network attacks on other systems. Network-Based IDS (NIDS) It has the ability to monitor traffic details, however, it cannot monitor the content of encrypted traffic. Remote sensors can be used by a single NIDS to collect data at crucial network locations, sending this data to a central management console. These sensors can monitor traffic at various network hardware such as routers, firewalls, and network switches that support port mirroring, as well as other types of network taps. Advantages A NIDS has minimal impact on overall network performance and, when deployed on a dedicated system, it does not affect performance on any other computer. It is typically capable of detecting the initiation of an attack or ongoing attacks. Disadvantages It may not always provide information about the success of an attack. It may not know if an attack has affected specific systems, user accounts, files, or applications. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a technology that helps in managing security by using tools that collect information about the IT environment from many disparate sources. The goal is to better examine the overall security of the organization and streamline security efforts. Role of SIEM SIEM solutions gather log data from various sources across the enterprise to better understand potential security concerns. These systems help in allocating resources appropriately, depending on the security needs. SIEM systems can work with other components as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, enhancing the overall information security program. Preventing Threats Keep Systems and Applications Up-to-Date: Vendors regularly release patches to correct bugs and security flaws, but these only help when they are applied. Patch management ensures that systems and applications are kept up to date with relevant patches. Remove or Disable Unneeded Services and Protocols: If a system doesn’t need a service or protocol, it should not be running. Attackers cannot exploit a vulnerability in a service or protocol that isn’t running on a system. Use Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems: Intrusion detection and prevention systems observe activity, attempt to detect threats and provide alerts. They can often block or stop attacks. Use Up-to-Date Anti-Malware Software: Various types of malicious code such as viruses and worms can be mitigated with up-to-date anti-malware software. Use Firewalls: Firewalls can prevent many different types of threats. Network-based firewalls protect entire networks, and host-based firewalls protect individual systems. Antivirus The use of antivirus products is strongly encouraged as a security best practice and is a requirement for compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Several antivirus products are available and many can be deployed as part of an enterprise solution integrating with several other security products. Antivirus systems aim to identify malware either by recognizing the signature of known malware or detecting abnormal system activity. This identification process utilizes various types of scanners, pattern recognition, and advanced machine learning algorithms. Modern anti-malware solutions go beyond mere virus protection, aiming to provide a more comprehensive approach, including detection of rootkits, ransomware, and spyware. Many endpoint solutions also include software firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Firewalls The term 'firewall' is borrowed from the field of building construction or vehicle design, where it refers to a physical barrier that prevents the spread of fire from one area to another. In the context of computer security, firewalls act as a security measure to isolate network segments from each other. Firewalls enforce security policies by filtering network traffic based on a set of rules. Firewalls can manage traffic at Layers 2 (MAC addresses), 3 (IP ranges), and 7 (application programming interface (API) and application firewalls), but traditionally, they have been implemented to control traffic at Layer 4. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a special type of active IDS (Intrusion Detection System) that automatically attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach the target systems. The key distinguishing difference between an IDS and an IPS is that the IPS is placed in line with the traffic. This means that all traffic must pass through the IPS. After analyzing the traffic, the IPS can decide what to forward and what to block, thus preventing an attack from reaching its target. IPS systems are most effective at preventing network-based attacks. Therefore, it is common to see the IPS function integrated into firewalls. Just like IDS, IPS also have two variants: Network-based IPS (NIPS) and Host-based IPS (HIPS).

4.3.1 On-premises An on-premise data center requires typically requires: HVAC (Humidity, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) System. Power. Fire Suppression. Data Center/Closet. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) / Environmental Control Proper management of environmental factors, including temperature and air quality, is crucial for the efficient operation of data centers. Temperature Control: High-density equipment and equipment within enclosed spaces require adequate cooling and airflow. The recommended temperature range for optimized maximum uptime and hardware life is from 64 to 81F (18 to 27C). It is also recommended that a rack should have three temperature sensors positioned at the top, middle, and bottom to measure the actual operating temperature of the environment. Air Quality Control: Aside from temperature and airflow, the quality of air is also crucial. Contaminants like dust and noxious fumes can impact the performance and lifespan of equipment. Hence, appropriate controls to minimize their presence are essential. Monitoring Systems: Monitoring systems for potential hazards like water or gas leaks, sewer overflow, or HVAC failure should be integrated into the building control environment. These systems should provide alarms to alert the staff about any anomalies promptly. Contingency Planning: Plans to respond to the warnings given by the monitoring systems should prioritize the systems in the building. This way, the impact of a major system failure on people, operations, or other infrastructure can be minimized. Power Management Maintaining constant and consistent electrical power is vital for data center and information system operations. Fluctuations in power quality can affect system lifespan, while disruptions can halt operations entirely. Backup Generators: Backup generators should be sized adequately to cater to the critical load, which includes both the computing resources and the supporting infrastructure. These generators serve as an alternate power source during power outages. Battery Backups: Battery backups (also known as Uninterruptible Power Supply or UPS) should also be appropriately sized. They need to be capable of carrying the critical load until the backup generators start and stabilize. Regular Testing: Just like data backups, it is necessary to regularly test power backup systems. This ensures that the failover to alternate power sources functions correctly in real outage situations. Fire Suppression Appropriate fire detection and suppression systems are crucial in data center environments. The choice of system depends on several factors including the size of the room, typical human occupation, egress routes, and the potential risk of damage to the equipment. Water-Based Systems: While commonly used in many settings, water-based fire suppression systems can cause substantial harm to servers and other electronic components. Gas-Based Systems: Gas-based fire suppression systems are more friendly to electronics and often preferred in data centers. They extinguish fires by reducing the oxygen level in the room or by using chemical reactions to extinguish the fire. However, these gases can be toxic to humans and require proper safety measures. Considerations: The choice between different fire suppression systems often involves a trade-off between potential damage to equipment and safety risks to personnel. Appropriate safety measures and precautions should always be put in place to minimize both types of risks. Redundancy Redundancy is a crucial design principle in ensuring the reliability and availability of data centers. The concept involves creating duplicate components, so in case of a failure, a backup is always available. This concept is widely applied in various aspects of a data center. Utility Services: Risk assessments should determine whether multiple, separate utility service entrances are necessary for redundant communication channels and/or mechanisms. Power Supplies: For full redundancy, devices should have dual power supplies connected to diverse power sources. This ensures that if one power supply fails, the other can still provide the necessary power to keep the device running. Backup Power: Power sources should be backed up by batteries and generators. This provides a secondary source of power in case the primary power source fails. Generators: They work by burning gasoline, propane or even solar panel. In a high-availability environment, even generators should be redundant and powered by different fuel types. This provides additional layers of redundancy, ensuring that power is available even in the event of a generator or fuel source failure. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) To enhance Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) capabilities, organizations often enter into agreements with similar organizations. In these agreements, the parties commit to sharing resources and operational space in the event of an emergency that prevents normal functioning. For instance, two competing hospitals in the same city might have an agreement that if one hospital experiences an emergency (like a fire, flood, power loss), the affected hospital can temporarily relocate personnel and systems to the other hospital. These agreements, known as joint operating agreements (JOA), memoranda of understanding (MOU), or memoranda of agreement (MOA), help protect the involved entities and their industries as a whole. They can be mandated by regulatory requirements or simply be part of administrative safeguards within an industry. The primary difference between an MOA/MOU and a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is that: An MOA/MOU relates to what can be done with a system or the information. An SLA provides granular details about the services, such as the availability of technicians or specific accessibility timings for backup systems. We must be very cautious when outsourcing with cloud-based services, because we have to make sure that we understand exactly what we are agreeing to. If the SLA promises 100 percent accessibility to information, is the access directly to you at the moment, or is it access to their website or through their portal when they open on Monday? That's where you'll rely on your legal team, who can supervise and review the conditions carefully before you sign the dotted line at the bottom. 4.3.2 Cloud Computing Cloud computing typically refers to an internet-based set of computing resources provided by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and usually sold as a service. Much like the power grid, cloud computing: - Is provisioned in a geographic location and sourced using methods not necessarily apparent to the consumer. - Provides services via a standard interface. - Allows users to pay only for what they use. Cloud computing is, therefore, a highly scalable, elastic, and user-friendly utility for the provisioning and deployment of Information Technology (IT) services. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a commonly cited definition of cloud computing: "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." - NIST SP 800-145 Characteristics: Metered Usage : Usage is measured and priced according to units (or instances) consumed. These costs can also be allocated back to specific departments or functions within the organization. Reduced Cost of Ownership : Since there's no need to purchase any assets for everyday use, it eliminates asset depreciation over time, and reduces associated maintenance and support costs. Energy Efficiency : Cloud computing can help reduce energy and cooling costs, contributing to "green IT" initiatives through optimal use of IT resources and systems. Scalability : Cloud computing allows an enterprise to scale up new software or data-based services/solutions quickly, without having to install substantial hardware locally. Service Models Software as a Service (SaaS) Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model providing access to software applications over the network. SaaS applications are hosted and maintained by a cloud service provider or vendor. Users can access these services with an internet connection and credentials. SaaS automatically manages updates and patches. SaaS offers ease of use and requires minimal administration from the user. All users run the same version of the software, ensuring standardization and compatibility. Platform as a Service (PaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for customers to build and operate their own software applications. It allows customers to rent virtualized servers and associated services over the internet from a cloud service provider. Customers don't manage the underlying cloud infrastructure (like network, servers, operating systems or storage), but they control the deployed applications and possibly the configurations of the application-hosting environment. PaaS provides a toolkit for conveniently developing, deploying and administering application software. It's structured to support large numbers of consumers, process large quantities of data and can potentially be accessed from any point on the internet. PaaS clouds typically provide a set of software building blocks, development tools like programming languages and supporting run-time environments. They also typically provide tools that assist with the deployment of new applications. In some cases, deploying a new software application in a PaaS cloud is as simple as uploading a file to a web server. PaaS clouds provide and maintain the computing resources (like processing, storage and networking) needed for consumer applications to operate. The operating system in a PaaS environment can be changed and upgraded frequently, along with associated features and system services. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides network access to traditional computing resources like processing power and storage. It delivers basic computing resources to consumers, which includes servers, storage and sometimes networking resources. Consumers install operating systems and applications on these resources and perform all required maintenance on the operating systems and applications. While consumers can use the related equipment, the cloud service provider retains ownership and is ultimately responsible for hosting, running, and maintaining the hardware. IaaS is also referred to as 'hardware as a service' by some customers and providers. Benefits of IaaS for organizations include: The ability to scale up and down infrastructure services based on actual usage. This is beneficial in situations where there are significant spikes and dips in the usage curve for infrastructure. Retaining system control at the operating system level. Deployment Models Public Public clouds refer to cloud services that are available to the general public. Access to public clouds is typically straightforward, requiring application for the service and payment. It is a shared resource, allowing multiple users to use the service as part of a resource pool. A public cloud deployment model provides assets that any consumers can rent or lease. These assets are hosted by an external cloud service provider (CSP). Service level agreements can be used to ensure that the CSP delivers the cloud-based services at a level that is acceptable to the organization. Private Private clouds are similar to public clouds, but instead of being shared with the public, they are typically developed and deployed for a specific organization. This model includes cloud-based assets for a single organization. The organization can either build and manage their private clouds using their own resources or rent resources from a third-party, with maintenance requirements split based on the service model (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS). Private clouds provide organizations and their departments with exclusive access to computing, storage, networking, and software assets available within the private cloud. Hybrid A hybrid cloud model combines two forms of cloud computing deployment models, typically a public and a private cloud. This model is gaining popularity as it provides organizations the ability to retain control of their IT environments. It allows for the use of public cloud services for non-mission-critical workloads while taking advantage of flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. Key benefits of hybrid cloud deployments include: Retaining ownership and oversight of critical tasks and processes related to technology. Reusing previous investments in technology within the organization. Maintaining control over most critical business components and systems. Providing a cost-effective means to fulfill non-critical business functions using public cloud components. Community Community clouds can be either public or private, making them unique. These clouds are generally developed for a specific community with shared interests or objectives. Examples include a public community cloud focused on organic food or a community cloud specifically for financial services. The concept of a community cloud allows people with similar interests or objectives to come together, share IT capabilities and services, and utilize them in a way that is beneficial to their shared interests. Managed Service Provider A Managed Service Provider (MSP) is a company that oversees information technology assets for another company. MSPs are commonly employed by small and medium-sized businesses to manage daily operations or provide expertise in areas the company lacks. MSPs can provide services such as network and security monitoring, patching services, and cloud-based services. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) is an example of a cloud-based service provided by MSPs, where the vendor monitors firewall and other security tools to provide expertise in handling events. Other common MSP services include: Augmenting in-house staff for projects Providing specialized expertise for implementing a product or service Offering payroll services Managing Help Desk service Monitoring and responding to security incidents Managing all in-house IT infrastructure Service-Level Agreement A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) is a contractual agreement between a cloud service provider and a cloud service customer that outlines the quality of the cloud services delivered. SLA is similar to a rule book and legal contract, detailing the minimum level of service, availability, security, controls, processes, communications, support, and other critical business elements agreed upon by both parties. The main purpose of an SLA is to document specific parameters, minimum service levels, and remedies for any failure to meet the specified requirements. It should also confirm data ownership and specify data return and destruction details. Important aspects of an SLA can include: Cloud system infrastructure details and security standards Customer right to audit legal and regulatory compliance by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Rights and costs associated with continuing and discontinuing service use Service availability Service performance Data security and privacy Disaster recovery processes Data location Data access Data portability Problem identification and resolution expectations Change management processes Dispute mediation processes Exit strategy 4.3.3 Design Network Segmentation Network segmentation is a process that involves managing and controlling traffic among networked devices. Complete or physical network segmentation refers to the isolation of a network from all outside communications. In this kind of segmentation, transactions can only occur between devices within the segmented network. This approach enhances security by limiting potential exposure to threats and containing them within the segmented network, should they occur. It also improves network performance by reducing unnecessary traffic. Network segmentation is a key strategy in network design and is commonly used in cybersecurity measures to reduce attack surfaces. Demilitarized zone (DMZ) A DMZ, or Demilitarized Zone, is a specific part of the network that is designed to be accessed by outside users. Despite being accessible from outside, it is still isolated from the organization's private internal network. DMZ is a security measure used to protect the internal network from potential external threats. It often hosts public-facing services such as web servers, email servers, file servers, and other resources. The DMZ acts as a buffer zone, reducing the risk of an intruder reaching the internal network even if they compromise a server within the DMZ. Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are a network configuration strategy that allows for the logical segmentation of networks. VLANs are created by network switches . With VLANs, you can divide a physical network into multiple logical networks without changing the physical connections or layout. These logical networks can group together devices regardless of their physical location. VLANs enhance network security and efficiency by reducing broadcast traffic, simplifying network management, and enforcing security policies. In a diagram, two or more VLANs would appear as separate networks even though they may share the same physical switch or switches. VLANs allow network administrators to create software-based LAN segments using switches. This can help segregate or consolidate traffic across multiple switch ports. Devices within a VLAN communicate through switches as if they were on the same Layer 2 network. Communications between different VLANs must be enabled as they act as separate networks. Broadcast traffic is limited to the VLAN, reducing congestion and limiting the effectiveness of certain attacks. VLAN administration simplifies network management, as VLANs can be reconfigured when users change their physical location or require access to different services. VLANs can be configured based on switch port, IP subnet, MAC address, and protocols. VLANs do not guarantee network security. There exist attacks (e.g., VLAN hopping) that allow malicious users to intercept traffic from other VLANs. VLAN technology is one tool among many that can improve the overall security of a network environment. Virtual Private Network (VPN) A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool that provides secure, encrypted connections over the internet. It establishes a "tunnel" for point-to-point transmission of both authentication and data traffic over a network that may not be secure (often the public internet). VPNs protect the data traffic from potential eavesdropping, tampering, or theft while in transit. They can be used to connect individual users (remote workers) to a network or to connect multiple networks together securely. In a typical setup, workstations access the internet through a firewall and a VPN for added security. Defense In Depth Defense in depth is a cyber security strategy that uses a layered approach to protect information systems. It utilizes multiple types of security controls (preventive, detective, corrective, etc.) arranged in literal or theoretical layers. The aim is to prevent a single point of failure in the system. If one layer is breached, others are still in place to protect the system. This approach avoids a monolithic security stance where a single failure could compromise the entire system. Controls may include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access controls, data encryption, and network segmentation among others. The layers of defense might include physical security, network security, computer security, application security, and policies/training/awareness. The concept is based on a military strategy by the same name and applies the idea that it's more difficult for an attacker to breach multiple layers of defense compared to just one. It involves various types of controls: administrative, technological, and physical that all work together to secure an organization and its systems. Examples of these layers include: Data: Controls protect the actual data, for example, using encryption, data leak prevention, identity and access management. Application: Controls protect the application itself, such as application firewalls and database monitors. Host: Controls at the endpoint level, for example, antivirus software, endpoint firewalls, configuration and patch management. Internal network: Controls protect against uncontrolled data flow and user access across the network, such as intrusion detection systems, internal firewalls, and network access controls. Perimeter: Controls protect against unauthorized network access. This includes gateway firewalls, honeypots, malware analysis and secure DMZs. Physical: Physical barriers like locks, walls, and access controls. Policies, Procedures, and Awareness: Administrative controls that reduce insider threats and identify risks early on. Network Access Control (NAC) The network is one of an organization's most crucial assets. Therefore, knowing and controlling access to it is vital. Network access initially was limited to internal devices but expanded to include remote connections over time, especially with the introduction of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the Internet of Things (IoT). A wide variety of devices could be found within an organization due to IoT, ranging from HVAC systems and security systems to vending machines. An effective NAC solution should enforce the organization's access control and associated security policies. A NAC device provides the necessary network visibility for access security and can be utilized for incident response. The NAC device should be capable of isolating noncompliant devices within a quarantined network and provide a mechanism to correct noncompliant elements. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all devices seeking to join the network comply with the requirements outlined in the organization's policies. The visibility provided by NAC should cover internal users as well as temporary users such as guests or contractors, and any devices they bring into the organization. Some use cases for NAC deployment include: Medical devices IoT devices BYOD/mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones) Guest users and contractors It plays a key role in maintaining the security of a network, especially in larger organizations with many network users and devices. Zero Trust Zero Trust is a security model that operates on the fundamental principle of "never trust, always verify." It suggests that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and should instead verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. Zero Trust networks are often microsegmented, with firewalls or security boundary control devices at nearly every connecting point to prevent unrestricted movement within the network. This concept recognizes that users with free reign inside a trust-but-verify environment can potentially find and exploit vulnerabilities. The analogy of a rock concert is often used to explain Zero Trust. In a traditional environment, once you show your ticket at the entrance, you have full access to the venue. In a Zero Trust environment, your ticket (or credentials) would be checked multiple times at different stages. Zero Trust adds defenses at the user, asset, and data level, rather than focusing solely on perimeter defense. It insists that every process or action a user attempts to take must be authenticated and authorized. While microsegmentation focuses on adding internal perimeters, Zero Trust shifts the focus to assets or data, protecting these directly rather than merely reinforcing the surrounding walls. ![[Pasted image 20230723162428.png]] Network Segmentation For Embedded Systems and Internet of Things (IoT) Embedded systems are computers implemented as part of a larger system, designed around a limited set of specific functions. Examples of embedded systems include network-attached printers, smart TVs, HVAC controls, smart appliances, smart thermostats, and medical devices. Network-enabled devices are portable or nonportable devices with native network capabilities. These devices can include smartphones, mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs or streaming media players, network-attached printers, game systems, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the collection of devices that can communicate over the internet with one another or with a control console. IoT devices could also be labeled as smart devices or smart-home equipment. Many industrial environmental control ideas found in office buildings are now available for small offices or personal homes. Embedded systems and network-enabled devices communicating with the internet are considered IoT devices and need special security measures. A security breach in an embedded system can potentially cause harm to people and property due to its control over a mechanism in the physical world. Many of these devices have multiple access routes (ethernet, wireless, Bluetooth, etc.), which require special care to isolate them from other devices on the network. Logical network segmentation can be imposed using switches, VLANs, or other traffic-control means, including MAC addresses, IP addresses, physical ports, protocols, or application filtering, routing, and access control management. Network segmentation can be used to isolate IoT environments, enhancing their security. Microsegmentation Current adversaries employ polymorphic toolsets that enable threats to bypass static security controls. Modern cyberattacks exploit traditional security models to move freely between systems within a data center. Microsegmentation aids in defending against these threats. Understanding the protection requirements for traffic within a data center and for traffic to and from the internet traffic flows is a fundamental design requirement of microsegmentation. By avoiding infrastructure-centric design paradigms, organizations can become more efficient at service delivery in the data center. Moving away from infrastructure-centric designs also enables organizations to be better at detecting and preventing advanced persistent threats.

5.1 Data Handling Lifecycle Of Data Creation Processing Storage Transmission Access Archiving Destruction/Disposal Data Handling Processes Classification Recognizing Value and Securing Data : Businesses classify data in recognition of its value. Classifications dictate the rules and restrictions about how that data can be used, stored, or shared. The purpose of classification is to prevent the leakage of data, maintaining its value and importance. Pre-labeling Assessment : Before data can be labeled with its sensitivity level or handling requirements, the potential impact or loss to the organization if the data is compromised needs to be assessed. This process forms the basis for classification. Classification : Classification is a process that identifies the potential organizational impacts if data suffers any security compromises, particularly relating to its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The information is then labeled and handled accordingly. Sources of Classification : Classifications are often derived from laws, regulations, contractual standards, or business expectations. These classifications may range from minor disruptions to grave threats that could lead to loss of life or pose existential threats to the organization. Benefits of Classification : Classification can lead to a more efficient design and implementation of security processes. If data with similar classifications can be protected using the same controls strategy, this can streamline security processes and make them more effective. Labeling Highly Restricted : This label is assigned to data whose compromise could significantly threaten the organization's existence. The unauthorized access or loss of such data could lead to substantial loss of life, injury, property damage, and subsequent litigation or claims. Moderately Restricted : This level of sensitivity is applied to data whose compromise could lead to temporary loss of competitive advantage, financial loss, or disruption of planned investments or activities. While the consequences are not as severe as "highly restricted" data, they still could have significant impacts. Low Sensitivity / Internal Use Only : Data with this label is not intended for public release but its compromise could cause minor disruptions, delays, or impacts to the organization. It is typically data that is meant for use within the organization and doesn't contain highly sensitive information. Unrestricted / Public Data : This category includes data that is already publicly available or intended for public release. No harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure of this data, as it's intended for public consumption. Retention Purpose of Data Retention : Data should only be retained for as long as it is beneficial to the organization. The period of retention may be determined by industry standards, laws, regulations, or organizational policies. Scope of Data Retention : Data retention policies apply to both hard copies and electronic data. No data should be kept beyond its required or useful life. Security Professionals' Role : Security professionals need to ensure that data destruction is carried out when an asset reaches its retention limit. This requires an accurate inventory that includes information about the asset location, retention period requirement, and destruction requirements. Periodic Review : Organizations should conduct periodic reviews of retained records to minimize the volume of stored information and ensure only necessary information is preserved. Records Retention Policies : These policies indicate how long an organization is required to maintain information and assets. They should ensure that personnel understand the various retention requirements for different types of data, the organization documents the retention requirements, and the organization retains information according to the required schedule but no longer. Common Mistake : A common error is applying the longest retention period to all types of information in an organization. This increases storage costs and risks of data exposure, adds noise when searching for relevant records, and may violate externally mandated requirements. Destruction of Records : Records and information no longer required should be destroyed in accordance with the enterprise's policies and any applicable legal requirements. Destruction Understanding Data Remanence : Data remanence refers to the residual data that might remain on a device even after data deletion. This residual data could pose significant security threats if not addressed properly. Clearing the Device : One way to address data remanence is by clearing the device. This process involves writing multiple patterns of random values throughout all storage media. This method, sometimes referred to as overwriting or zeroing, may still leave recoverable sensitive information if some blocks or storage extents are missed during the process. Purging the Device : Another method to address data remanence is by purging the device, a process which eliminates or greatly reduces the chance of recovering residual data from the original values, even after the system has been cleared. Some storage technologies may still leave "ghost" data after being overwritten multiple times, which purging aims to eliminate. Physical Destruction : The most secure method of preventing data remanence is physically destroying the device. This could involve shredding, chopping, breaking, etching in acid, or burning the device. The remains may then be buried in protected landfills. Clearing vs Purging/Destruction : While clearing might be sufficient in routine operational environments, when system elements are to be removed and replaced, either as part of maintenance upgrades or for disposal, purging or destruction may be necessary to fully protect sensitive information from potential attacks. Logging and Monitoring Security Events Logging is a crucial aspect of maintaining security in systems as it captures signals generated by events and changes within the system. Information that may be relevant to log includes user IDs, system activities, dates/times of key events, device and location identity, system access attempts, and system configuration changes. Monitoring the health of the information environment is essential for identifying inefficient systems, detecting compromises, and providing a record of system usage. Log reviews are vital for security assessment and testing, identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activities, and operational problems in near real-time. Log reviews also support audits and forensic analysis related to internal and external investigations, and provide a basis for organizational security baselines. Creating a log management infrastructure helps preserve the integrity of log data from accidental or intentional modification or deletion and maintains the confidentiality of log data. Controls should be implemented to protect against unauthorized changes to log information, including alterations to the recorded messages, log files being edited or deleted, and the storage capacity of log file media being exceeded. Organizations need to adhere to a retention policy for logs as prescribed by law, regulations, and corporate governance. Policies and procedures should be in place to address the preservation of original logs and to protect the log data from malicious use, as logs contain valuable and sensitive information about the organization. Best Practices Ingress monitoring refers to the surveillance and assessment of all inbound communications traffic and access attempts. Tools used for this include: Firewalls Gateways Remote authentication servers Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) tools Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions Anti-malware solutions Egress monitoring is used to regulate data leaving the organization's IT environment, often through Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or Data Leak Protection solutions. DLP solutions should be able to inspect all forms of data leaving the organization, such as: Email (content and attachments) Copy to portable media File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Posting to web pages/websites Applications/Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) 5.1.2 Encryption Overview An encryption system consists of hardware, software, algorithms, control parameters, and operational methods, all designed to provide encryption services. Plaintext refers to data or messages in their normal, unencrypted form. The information in plaintext is immediately available for use by the end user (either a person or a process). Plaintext can take many forms, including: Image, audio, or video files, either in raw or compressed formats. Human-readable text and numeric data, potentially featuring markup language elements for formatting and metadata. Database files or records and fields within a database. Any other data that can be represented digitally for computer processing, transmission, and storage. Importantly, plaintext is not necessarily human-readable and can encompass a broad range of digital data. Symmetric Encryption Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption where the same key is used for both the encryption and decryption processes. This encryption method ensures data security as only someone with the correct key can decrypt the message. However, symmetric encryption presents several challenges: If two parties suspect a communication path between them is compromised, they cannot share the key via that path as it would likely be intercepted. Distribution of the key is difficult as it must be sent through a different channel (out-of-band key distribution) than the encrypted message to prevent interception. Any party with knowledge of the key can access and potentially alter the message. The scalability of symmetric encryption is challenging because the number of keys grows rapidly as the number of different users or groups increases. For example, an organization of 1,000 employees would need to manage 499,500 keys if every employee wanted to communicate confidentially with every other employee. ![[Pasted image 20230723181656.png]] It is also used for: Encrypting bulk data, such as backups, hard drives, and portable media. Encrypting messages that are traversing communication channels, like IPsec and TLS. Streaming large-scale, time-sensitive data, such as audio/video materials and gaming. Symmetric algorithms are also known by several other names: Same key Single key Shared key Secret key Session key An example of symmetric encryption is a substitution cipher, which involves substituting letters for other letters or bits for other bits, based on a cryptovariable. For instance, these ciphers may involve replacing each letter of the plaintext with another letter that's further down the alphabet. Asymmetric Encryption Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and a different key to decrypt the input plaintext, as opposed to symmetric encryption that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. To use asymmetric encryption, a user generates a key pair: one is kept secret (the private key), and the other can be given freely to anyone (the public key). Anyone can encrypt a message using the recipient's public key, but only the recipient with their private key can decrypt it. Asymmetric encryption solves the problem of key distribution by allowing secure message transfer across an untrusted medium without needing prior key exchange or key material distribution. Other features of asymmetric encryption include non-repudiation of origin and delivery, access control, and data integrity. Asymmetric encryption solves the problem of scalability as each party only requires a key pair, reducing the total number of keys needed compared to symmetric encryption. The main disadvantage of asymmetric encryption is its slowness compared to symmetric encryption due to its handling of much larger keys and more intensive mathematical operations. This makes it impractical for everyday use in encrypting large amounts of data or for frequent transactions where speed is required. ![[Pasted image 20230723182111.png]] Hashing Hashing Basics : Hashing is a cryptographic process that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a 'digest' that is unique to each unique input. One-Way Function : Hash functions are designed to be one-way, meaning that once data is hashed, it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input from the hash output. This makes hashing a useful tool for storing sensitive information like passwords. Password Hashing : In the context of password storage, when a user creates an account or changes their password, the password is run through a hash function, and the resulting hash is stored in the database. The original password is not stored. Verification : When the user logs in, the password they provide is hashed again, and the resulting hash is compared with the stored hash in the database. If the hashes match, the password is correct. Salting : To prevent attacks using precomputed tables of hashes (rainbow tables), a random value called a 'salt' is often added to the password before hashing. The salt is stored alongside the hash in the database. This means that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different due to the unique salts. Peppering : In addition to salting, peppering involves adding a secret value before hashing. The 'pepper' is not stored in the database, adding another layer of security if the database is compromised. Multiple Rounds of Hashing : To increase the computational cost of generating hashes (and thus slow down attackers), many systems apply the hash function multiple times in what's known as key stretching. Modern Hashing Algorithms : Algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 are designed for password hashing and include built-in salting and key stretching.

5.2 Configuration Management Overview Identification : Recognizing and tracking essential system configurations. Baseline : Establishing a reference point, or snapshot, of system configuration at a particular point in time. Control : Managing and controlling any changes made to the system. Updates and Patches : Regular implementation and verification of system updates and patches. Accountability : Tracking all changes made to the system including who made them, when they were made, and why. Auditing and Reviews : Regular system checks to ensure it is functioning as intended and is secure. Documentation : Properly documenting all aspects of the system's configuration and changes made. Inventory First Step in Asset Management : Making an inventory, catalog, or registry of all the organization's information assets is the first step in any asset management process. Identify All Assets : It's important to locate and identify all assets, especially the information assets. The axiom to remember is: "You can't protect what you don’t know you have." Keeping Inventory Consistent and Current : It's a challenge to keep the inventory and its status with respect to updates and patches consistent and current over time. Challenging Task : Identifying every physical host and endpoint, and gathering data from them all, can be a challenging task in asset management. Baseline Defining Baselines : A baseline is a comprehensive inventory of all a system’s components including hardware, software, data, administrative controls, documentation, and user instructions. Referencing Baselines : Once security controls are in place to mitigate risks, the baselines can be referenced. All further comparisons and development are measured against these baselines. Protection Level : Baselines are particularly helpful in achieving a minimal protection level of assets based on their value. Security Requirements : If assets are classified based on their value, and meaningful baselines are established for each classification level, we can ensure conformance to the minimum levels of security required for each. For example, if classifications such as high, medium, and low are being used, baselines could be developed for each of these classifications to provide the minimum level of security required. Updates Repairs and Maintenance : Systems elements often require updates, maintenance, and repairs. This can involve all levels from basic IT architecture, operating systems, applications platforms, networks, and user interfaces. Acceptance Testing : Any modifications, updates, or repairs must be acceptance tested. This testing verifies that newly installed functionality works as intended. Regression Testing : In addition to acceptance testing, modifications must also undergo regression testing. This ensures that the modifications did not introduce any unexpected or erroneous behaviors into the system. Ongoing Security Assessment : Regular security assessment and evaluation testing is essential. This assesses whether the system that passed initial acceptance testing remains secure after any changes. It's crucial to continually assess security to adapt to new threats and ensure the system remains secure. Patches Regular Maintenance : Patch management is an ongoing process as patches can come at irregular intervals from many vendors. Some patches are critical and should be deployed quickly, while others are not as critical but should still be deployed because subsequent patches may depend on them. Testing Patches : Before implementing a patch across an organization, it should be tested to ensure it doesn't negatively affect system functionality. However, due to budget restrictions, many organizations may not have a test environment that accurately mirrors their production environment, posing a risk that issues might arise in the production environment that weren't identified in testing. Rollback Plan : If a patch causes problems, it may be necessary to rollback the system to a previous state before the patch was applied. It's important to have a documented rollback plan ready in case it's needed. Unattended Patching : Many vendors offer patch management solutions that include automated processes, or unattended updates. While this can help ensure systems are patched promptly, it may also result in unscheduled outages if systems need to be taken offline or rebooted as part of the patch process. The risks of unattended patching should be weighed against the risks of having unpatched systems.

Appropriate use of data : The policy defines how data is to be used within an organization. Some data may be restricted to specific roles, or it could be made public to anyone outside the organization. Legal usage definitions : Some data has legal usage definitions that must be adhered to. The organization's policy should clearly outline these restrictions or provide a reference to the legal definitions. Compliance with laws and regulations : Proper data classification can assist an organization in maintaining compliance with relevant laws and regulations. For instance, classifying credit card data as confidential can help ensure compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Encryption requirements : The data classification policy should clearly define the requirements for data encryption. For instance, if credit card information is classified as confidential, the policy should require that such data be encrypted as per PCI DSS specifications. 5.3.2 Password Policy Every organization should establish a password policy that outlines the expectations for systems and users regarding password usage. The password policy should express the commitment of senior leadership to maintain secure access to data. The policy should also include any standards that the organization has adopted for creating passwords . This could include rules on password length, complexity, and expiration. The policy should clearly identify who is responsible for enforcing and validating the policy . This ensures accountability and that the policy is consistently upheld. 5.3.3 Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines the approved usage of an organization's assets , which includes IT infrastructure, devices, and data. AUP aids in protecting the organization from legal repercussions . Every employee or anyone with access to the organization's assets should be required to sign a copy of the AUP , ideally in the presence of another organizational employee. Both parties should keep a copy of the signed AUP. Common aspects usually covered in AUPs are: Data access System access Data disclosure Password management Data retention policies Internet usage rules Guidelines for company device usage. 5.3.4 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy allows employees to use their personal devices for work purposes. This could include laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc. While BYOD can boost employee morale due to familiarity and comfort with their own devices, it poses significant challenges to the security team. The challenges stem from a loss of control over standardization and privacy. BYOD increases the risk of data breaches, as personal devices may not adhere to the company's security standards. They may harbor vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited. In the case of a forensic audit, inspecting personal devices can be problematic due to privacy issues. It is crucial for organizations implementing a BYOD policy to establish clear user expectations and business rules. All employees must read and agree to adhere to this policy before they can access the company's systems, network, and data. As the workforce and the number of devices grow, the management and security around BYOD devices also become increasingly complex. Therefore, appropriate tools are required to manage and secure BYOD devices effectively. 5.3.5 Privacy Policy The organization’s privacy policy should define what is considered PII/ePHI. It should also detail appropriate handling procedures and mechanisms, user expectations, enforcement mechanisms, and punitive measures for non-compliance. The privacy policy should reference applicable regulations and legislation, which may vary based on geographical location or specific industry. Examples include the GDPR in the EU, PIPEDA in Canada, HIPAA, and GLBA in the US. The organization should create a public document detailing how it uses and protects private information. This includes both internal and external uses. In certain cases, such as with medical providers, this document may need to be presented to patients or be easily accessible (e.g., on the provider's website). 5.3.6 Change Management Policy Change management is a discipline that guides how we prepare, equip, and support individuals to successfully adopt change to drive organizational success and outcomes. It comprises three main activities: making the decision to implement a change, executing the change, and confirming that the change has been correctly carried out. Change management focuses on the decision-making process, which results in giving approvals to system support teams, developers, and end users to implement the proposed changes. Any changes made to a system, its individual components, or its operating environment throughout the system's lifecycle can potentially introduce new vulnerabilities, thus threatening the security of the enterprise. Therefore, change management necessitates a structured process to implement changes in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on business operations. Components Request For Change (RFC) Change management starts with a Request for Change (RFC). This could be due to an identified need for system enhancement, to rectify a detected problem, or to introduce new functionality. The proposed change then progresses through different stages including development, testing, and final approval stages. Each of these stages involves various checks and balances to ensure that the change will not disrupt existing processes or introduce vulnerabilities. Each stage in the change management process requires formalized management and decision-making. This is to ensure the change is necessary, feasible, and aligns with the organization's strategic goals. Every step in the change management process is documented. This includes logging the initial RFC, tracking its progress through the various stages, and recording the final implementation of the change. Documentation serves multiple purposes: it provides accountability, allows for auditability, aids in troubleshooting any issues that arise due to the change, and contributes to organizational learning. Once a change has been fully tested and approved, it is then released to the end users. User training may be part of this final step, especially if the change significantly affects system usage or workflows. Post-implementation reviews are typically conducted to assess the effectiveness of the change, and any lessons learned are incorporated into future change management processes. Approval Evaluating Request for Changes (RFCs) for Completeness: This involves assessing if the RFC contains all the necessary information including the purpose of the change, the components that will be affected, a detailed plan of the change, and potential risks involved. Assignment to Proper Change Authorization Process: Depending on the complexity and risk associated with the change, it is assigned to the appropriate change authorization process. This is determined based on risk assessments and established organizational practices. Stakeholder Reviews: All relevant stakeholders are involved in the review process. This could include departments that are affected by the change, IT teams responsible for implementing the change, and management who have to approve the change. Resource Identification and Allocation: This step involves determining what resources will be required to implement the change and ensuring they are allocated appropriately. Resources could include personnel, equipment, or software. Appropriate Approvals or Rejections: Once the change has been thoroughly reviewed and tested, it must be either approved or rejected by the relevant authorities in the organization. This decision is documented for future reference. Documentation of Approval or Rejection: Regardless of whether the change is approved or rejected, the decision, along with its reasoning, is recorded. This helps in maintaining a history of changes, which can be beneficial for future change management activities. Rollback Scheduling the Change: The proposed change needs to be scheduled for a time that minimizes disruption to the ongoing operations of the organization. Testing the Change: The change is tested in a controlled environment to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce any new issues or vulnerabilities. Verifying the Rollback Procedures: In case the change doesn't work as expected or introduces new issues, a rollback procedure should be in place. This procedure is verified to ensure it can effectively restore the system to its pre-change state. Implementing the Change: After thorough testing and verification of the rollback procedure, the change is implemented in the production environment. Evaluating the Change: Post-implementation, the change is evaluated to ensure it operates properly and effectively, and provides the intended benefits. Documenting the Change in the Production Environment: Detailed documentation of the change, including its nature, implementation process, and effects, is maintained. This helps in tracking changes over time and assists in troubleshooting any issues that may arise in the future. Rollback Authority: The authority to roll back a change should it not perform as expected is defined in the rollback plan. The rollback may be immediate or scheduled as a subsequent change based on the monitoring of the change's performance. Compliance Consequences for violating company policies should be clearly laid out and may include warnings, suspensions, or even termination depending on the severity of the violation. The details of these policies should be thoroughly explained during employee onboarding, especially for those working in information security roles. The responsibility for enforcing these policies should be clearly defined and known to all employees. As part of the onboarding process, employees should sign documentation indicating they understand and agree to comply with these policies. To ensure understanding, a short survey or quiz could be implemented to test employee comprehension of the policies. All security and data handling procedures should be supported by comprehensive policies, which contribute to an organization's baseline security posture.

5.4 Purpose Understanding Expectations: Awareness training educates employees about the expectations the organization has for them regarding their responsibilities and accountabilities. It teaches them about the policies, procedures, and standards that are in place, and how to comply with them. Identifying Carelessness or Complacency: Awareness training helps identify if there are any areas where employees are careless or complacent, which could potentially pose a risk to the organization. By addressing these issues, the training helps reduce risks associated with human error. Aligning with Organizational Goals: The training ensures that employees are aware of how their actions and behaviors align with the information security goals of the organization. This understanding helps them see how their daily work contributes to the overall mission and vision of the organization Creating a Secure Environment: Through awareness training, employees become more mindful of potential security risks and threats, and how to avoid or mitigate them. This contributes to creating a more secure environment within the organization. Compliance with Regulations: Depending on the industry, certain regulations may require regular awareness training for employees. This training ensures that the organization stays compliant and avoids any penalties associated with non-compliance. Promoting a Culture of Security: Beyond simply conveying rules and procedures, awareness training helps instill a culture of security within the organization where every employee understands their role in safeguarding the organization's data and systems. What Is Security Awareness Training For ? Education: Security awareness education involves providing employees with an understanding of cybersecurity principles, threats, and best practices. This includes understanding the significance of information security and how their individual actions can impact the organization's security posture. Training: The training component involves teaching specific skills or actions related to security. This could include how to identify and respond to phishing emails, how to properly manage passwords, or how to securely handle sensitive information. The goal is to build proficiency in these skills to reduce the risk of security incidents. Awareness: Security awareness involves making employees aware of the various security risks and threats they may encounter in their role, and the importance of their role in mitigating these risks. Awareness activities might include presentations, posters, newsletters, or regular email updates about recent threats or security updates. Education: Hosting seminars or workshops on key security topics. Providing eLearning modules on various cybersecurity topics. Offering access to cybersecurity books, articles, and webinars. Training: Conducting phishing simulations to help users recognize malicious emails. Running mock scenarios to test employee response to security incidents. Using interactive games or challenges to teach users about security concepts. Awareness: Sending regular newsletters or email updates with latest security news and tips. Posting cybersecurity posters or infographics around the office. Encouraging participation in security-related events, like cybersecurity awareness month. Phishing Whaling Attacks What are Whaling Attacks? Whaling attacks are a type of phishing attack that specifically targets high-profile employees, such as the CEO or CFO, in order to steal sensitive information from a company. The term whaling is used to depict the size of the targets relative to typical phishing attacks, symbolizing the bigger 'fish' in the company hierarchy. How Do They Work? In whaling attacks, cybercriminals impersonate senior executives and send emails to lower-level employees, usually within the finance department, requesting a wire transfer or sensitive data. These emails are often sophisticated, using the executive's style of writing, their email signature, and include relevant details that make the request seem legitimate. Why are They Dangerous? Whaling attacks are particularly dangerous because they use the trust and authority of senior executives to deceive employees into taking actions they normally wouldn’t. Additionally, due to the high level of customization in these attacks, they can be harder to detect than regular phishing attempts. Preventing Whaling Attacks: Prevention measures include educating all staff, especially senior executives and finance teams, about the risk of whaling attacks; implementing robust processes for financial transactions that require multiple approvals; and using advanced email security solutions that can detect and block such attacks. Social Engineering Social engineering is a strategy used by cyber attackers to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information. The aim is to exploit human vulnerabilities to break security protocols. This method plays on human tendencies and is effective because it's easier to exploit a person's natural inclination to trust than it is to discover ways to hack their software. The text mentions several types of social engineering tactics: Phone Phishing or Vishing: This involves the use of a fraudulent interactive voice response (IVR) system that mimics the IVR system of a legitimate institution, such as a bank. The victim is usually prompted by a phishing email to call a provided phone number, where they're asked to verify sensitive information like account numbers, access codes, or PINs. Pretexting: This involves impersonating an authority figure or trusted individual to obtain access to login information. The attacker may claim to be an IT support worker, an investigator performing a company audit, or even a coworker or a tax authority. Quid Pro Quo: In this scenario, the attacker offers a compensation (like a free gift or access to an online service) in exchange for the victim's password or login credentials. Tailgating: This tactic involves following an authorized user into a restricted area or system. In a low-tech scenario, this could be a person asking you to hold the door open because they forgot their company RFID card. In a more sophisticated version, someone may ask to borrow your phone or laptop to perform a simple action, during which they install malicious software onto your device. Password Protection Password managers are tools that can store multiple passwords securely, relieving the user of the need to remember multiple passwords. There's a potential risk of compromising the password manager itself, especially if protected by a weak password or passphrase. Cloud storage of passwords, while convenient, can also be a risk if not properly secured. Organizations should encourage unique passwords for each system and recommend a reliable password management solution. Practices to avoid include: Reusing passwords across multiple systems, especially for both business and personal use. Writing down passwords and leaving them in unsecured areas. Sharing passwords with tech support or co-workers.

Ubuntu Fundamentals Introduction to Linux Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: Explain Linux Differentiate between Linux, Windows, and Unix Explain the concept of open source Illustrate why there are different Linux distributions Linux • Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. • Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds, specifically for Intel platforms. OS Architecture • The hardware essentially consists of a CPU, like Intel or AMD, along with a RAM and a hard disk with supporting electronic chips known as chip sets. • The core component of an OS is known as kernel. • There is a shell layer that acts as an interface between the kernel and users. This is the operating system. • You can use the applications that perform specific tasks on the shell layer. Linux vs. Windows • Linux is an open-source OS and there are no license charges, whereas Windows is owned by Microsoft Inc. Therefore, it is a proprietary OS. • Linux uses traditional Unix permissions and POSIX ACL (Access Control List) for file access, whereas Windows uses ACL. Linux vs. Windows • Windows differs from Linux in terms of the architecture. Linux has a monolithic kernel, whereas Windows has a microkernel. • To launch applications, Linux uses virtual memory, whereas Windows uses the physical memory. • In Linux, the desktop must be installed as an application, whereas in Windows it is part of the kernel. Linux vs. Windows Linux is customizable as it is an open-source operating system, unlike Windows. Linux is more secure when compared to Windows. Linux boots from any partition, whereas Windows will boot from the primary partition when you use the MBR partition scheme. Linux is case sensitive, whereas Windows is not case sensitive. Linux vs. UNIX Linux is developed by Linus Torvalds and a community effort which has its own standard called Linux Standard Base (LSB). UNIX follows the POSIX standard. Open Source • When the source code of a software is shared with the public for free, it is referred to as open source. • Open-source software is developed by the developer's community and shared voluntarily with the public. Multiple Distributions of Linux • Linux is a kernel and is like an engine for a car, and the car is the OS. • In the automobile industry, different brands use the same engine. In a similar way, multiple distributions of Linux use the same kernel. Key Takeaways Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. Open-source software is free for the general public. Windows and Linux are both operating systems with different architectures. Knowledge Check Knowledge Check A. B. C.

Ubuntu Fundamentals File System Organization Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: Illustrate the file system hierarchy in Ubuntu Explore the functions of important directories Evaluate configuration files and its uses Analyze the permissions of files and directories Add and delete users and groups Mount and unmount file systems File System Organization File system is the method of organizing and managing your data in files and directories. • The File system hierarchy begins with the root directory ‘/’. • It is also known as the mount point for the whole system through which your data flows and occupies space in files. Important Directories and Their Functions The various system directories in Ubuntu are: Important Directories and Their Functions bin: Contains all the user commands in binary format etc: Contains the system configuration files that manage your application’s behavior sbin: Contains all the commands used by the administrator. These commands are also known as privilege commands usr: Contains the kernel header files required for the kernel operations var: Stores all the logs and email messages dev: Contains the names of the connected devices. In Linux, devices are treated like files home: Saves the user’s work. It also saves the user’s profile settings lib: Saves the pre-compiled apps, frequently used by the OS apps proc: Contains the current state of the kernel and its settings used in current context root: It is the home directory for the administrator whose name is root. The administrator is also known as super user Some of the important directories are: Mount and Unmount Mounting refers to the process of attaching the file system to root. • The file system for all practical purposes can be considered partitions on the hard disk. • Unmounting refers to the process of detaching the file system from the root directory. Configuration Files in Linux (Ubuntu) • The behavior of systems and applications is controlled by the configuration file settings. • The files that contain these settings are known as configuration files. • Every application or service has the configuration followed by its name. Configuration Files in Linux (Ubuntu) Example: In the given screenshot, you can see the network card configuration as required by the network service application. Network service application’s job is to provide network connectivity based on the configuration described in the file. Permissions for Files and Directories User Rights Group Rights Others Rights In Linux, there are primarily two types of resources, files and directories, and there are three stakeholders present. They are user, group, and others. • The person who created the file is considered the user or owner. • People who like to access this file frequently are called group. • Remaining set of people forms the others category. Permissions for Files and Directories There are mainly three permissions given in Linux: • r stands for read, and it allows you to open the file. • w stands for write and allows you to edit the file. • x stands for execute, and it allows you to execute the program present in the file or directory. If none of the three permissions are assigned, then deny will be the default permission for that file or directory. • – stands for deny option # ls –l file -rwxr--r-- 1 root root θ Dec 29 23: 49 f i l e File type Owner (rw-) Group (r- -) Other (r - -) Permissions for Files and Directories Permissions can also be set by octal method. Here, numerical values are used instead of symbols. r = 4, w = 2, and x = 1 Permissions for Files and Directories Same permissions can be used for files in directories. • r indicates that you can go to the directory and read the files. • w indicates that you can create files in the folder. • x indicates that you can use the ls command to list the files in the folder. User Administration • Users interact with computer systems to accomplish their tasks by using system resources. • To accomplish these tasks, users require a user account to log into the system with the respective credentials. • Every user who sets up an account has a valid name, password for authentication, and a user identity number assigned by the system. • For more than one person, we have the group identity number for authorization. • Home directory is used to store the user’s profile, files, and other belongings followed by a default shell. User Administration Users can be added to the system by two methods: GUI and CLI • The minimum information required to perform this task are the name and password. • Both GUI or CLI method can be used to customize any attribute, but the CLI method is prefered most of the time. User Administration • Like addition, deletion of users can also be done using GUI and CLI methods. • The command # userdel <username> or # userdel -r <username> is used to remove or delete users from the system. o -r refers to the home directory. • Therefore, even the home directory is deleted along with the user details. User Administration • Groups are used when the ownership is required for more than one person. • Like user addition, groups can be added either by the GUI or CLI method. • There are two types of groups: o Primary group o Secondary group User Administration Primary group: • When a user is created by default, then the user is grouped under the primary group. • The name of this primary group follows the name of the user. • The command # groupadd <group_name> is used to add a group. Secondary group: • If a user wants to join an already present group, then the user is grouped under the secondary group. • The command # useradd -g <group_name> <username> is used to add a user to a secondary group. User Administration Like addition, deletion of groups can be done either by the GUI or CLI method. The command # groupdel <group_name> is used to delete the group. Key Takeaways File system is the method of organizing and managing your data in files and directories. sbin directory contains all the commands used by the administrator. They are also known as privilege commands. The behavior of systems and applications is controlled by the configuration files settings. Files and directories are the two types of resources in Ubuntu.

Ubuntu Fundamentals Introduction to CLI Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: Execute various commands in the terminal Apply superuser commands using the sudo command Find help for commands using manual pages Navigate through the file system Manipulate files and folders Execute system commands Starting Up the Terminal To start the terminal, right click on the mouse and select the option open terminal. Running Commands as Superuser A normal user does not have the privilege to perform certain tasks. • The sudo command in Linux elevates the privilege of a normal user to perform certain restricted tasks. • In Ubuntu, by default, a user can join the sudo group to get these facilities. • The user doesn’t require a root password of the root user to execute the privilege commands. Manual Pages • Manual pages have all the information about the commands. • They are also called man pages. • Example: man cat command to view the function, description, and options of the cat command. Manual Sections The manual pages are further divided into several sections. They are : • The Executable programs or shell commands • System calls • Library calls • Special files • File formats • Miscellaneous • Games • System admin commands • Kernel routines Manual Captions A command’s manual page has several captions: • Name • Synopsis • Description • Options • Exit values • Files man -k Command • Use the command man -k <keyword>, keyword can be anything. • Example: Check for printf. This command will extract all the text information that matches one or more characters from the keyword. • After extracting all the content, find the command from the list. It is printf in this case. • The number next to the command indicates the section of the man page this command belongs to. Find Command The type command or which command is used to find the version of a command. • The version of the command is selected based on the path variable. Moving Around the File System • A directory is a file that contains the names of the other files. • It is also called a pointer as it points to the files you are looking for. • The command $ ls-l can be used to list the contents of the directory and $ pwd to view the current working directory. Moving Around the File System • Every file or directory in Linux is assigned a numerical value called inode. • The system will not identify the files without the inode numbers. • Inode numbering will start from 2, as 0 and 1 are reserved numbers. • The default directory is root; its inode number is 2. A file is defined as the space occupied by data on the hard disk. Soft and Hard Links • As some files have long names, it might be difficult to refer to them. Soft links help you refer to the same files with a shorter version of the name. • You can use a soft link to create two or more names for a single file and use any one to refer to the file. Soft and Hard Links • Hard links are used to have a backup copy of the file without having to occupy any additional space. • This is useful in case of accidental deletion of files. So, even if one file is removed, you can retrieve the same data using the copied version. • Any change in one file gets reflected in all the copied files. • The copied files have the same inode number. Manipulating Commands Some of the commands used to manipulate files are: cp Copy mv Rename rm Remove ls List files and directories mkdir Create a directory chmod Change permissions chown Change ownership Creating Files and Directories • The three ways to create a file in Ubuntu are: o touch command o cat command o vi editor. • The file created by any of these three methods occupies zero bytes of space. • After entering the required data in the created file, use the control + d keys to save the file. Creating Files and Directories Hierarchy of directories can be created using this command. The mkdir command is used to create a directory. Syntax: mkdir <directory_name> Copying Files and Directories In Linux, the command cp is used to copy a file or its contents from one folder to another folder. Syntax: cp <source_filename> <destination_filename> Copying Files and Directories The different options available for the copy command are: Option Description -i Ask for user permission before writing to the destination file -b Create a backup copy of the destination file -f Copy file to the destination file forcefully if you don’t have permission -p Preserve file attributes if possible Copying Files and Directories • The copy command of a directory is similar to the copy command of a file. • The option -r will recursively copy the contents of the source directory to the destination directory. Syntax: cp -r <source_dir> <destination_dir> Renaming Files and Directories The mv command in Linux is used to rename a given file. Syntax: mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name> Renaming Files and Directories The same mv command is used to rename a directory. Syntax: mv <old_dir_name> <new_dir_name> Moving Files and Directories • The only change in the syntax is that instead of file or directory name, you use the file location. • If you compare the mv command with the cp command, you see that the mv command deletes the source location when it moves the files or directories to the destination location. Syntax: mv <source_location> <destination_location> The mv command used for renaming files and directories can be used to move them to a different location. Moving Files and Directories The different options available for the mv command are: Option Description -i Ask user’s permission before performing the task -f Ask user’s permission while writing protected files -n Prevent overwriting of an existing file at destination -b Backup the destination file Removing Files and Directories The rm command which stands for remove is used to delete or remove files and directories. A directory can be removed only after all the files and directories within it are removed. df Command The df command is used to view the file system usage and the mount point of the file system. df Command Option Description -a Display the information about the file systems -h Display the same file system information in a human readable format -i List the information of inode The different options available for the df command are: free Command The free command is used to display the information of memory used by the system. • There are two types of memories. Physical memory, represented by Mem, and swap memory. • The information displayed by the free command includes: total, used, free, shared, buff/cache, and available. top Command The top command is used to display the information of processes running in Linux. • The information provided is dynamic. • The different information displayed includes, PID, PR, VIRT, RES, SHR, USER, %CPU, TIME, NI, and %MEM. uname Command uname command will provide the information regarding the OS distribution, release version, CPU architecture, and kernel version. uname Command Option Description -a Print the system information in a specific order -s Print the kernel name -n Print the hostname -r Print the kernel version -v Print the current kernel version -m Print the machine hardware information The different options available for the uname command are: lsb_release Command The lsb_release command is used to display the installed Linux distributor ID, release version, and codename. lsb_release Command The different options available for the lsb_release command are: Option Description -a Print the OS distribution and releases information -d Display the description -c Display the code ip Command The ip command is used to display the IP related details of the system. The different information displayed includes interface name, ip address, network mask, and mac address. lspci Command The lspci command displays the machine hardware information based on the PCI architecture. The information includes PCI bridge, VGA controller, Ethernet controller, USB controller, audio device, and IDE interface. lsusb Command lsusb command is used to display the information of various USB devices connected to the system. Key Takeaways The sudo command in Linux elevates the privilege of a normal user to perform certain restricted tasks as a normal user. File system can be defined as a method of organizing and managing data in the form of files and directories. Soft links help you refer to a file with a long name with a shorter version of the name. mkdir command is used to create directories in Linux. Knowledge Check Knowledge Check A. B. C.

Ubuntu Fundamentals Editing Text Files and Search Patterns Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, you will be able to: Create files using the vi editor Copy or cut and paste data in the vi editor Apply different file operations using the vi editor Use grep or egrep for pattern matching Introduction to vi/vim Editor • Vi editor is the most used text editor in Linux. • It has been modified by the open-source community and the new version is known as vim. • Vi editor is also the default editor in Linux distributions. Different Modes of vi Editor Vi editor works in three different modes: • Command mode is used for navigation. • Input mode is used to enter and replace text. • Insert mode is used for pattern matching, saving, and quitting. Create and Assign File Name • Use the vim command on terminal to open the vi editor. • The default mode is command mode. Switch from Command Mode to Insert Mode The different keyboard characters used to switch from command mode to insert mode are given below: Option Description i Inserts data before the current character I Inserts data from the start of the current line a Inserts data after current character A Inserts data at the end of the line o Adds data one line below the cursor O Adds data one line above the cursor Save and Quit File • Shift colon key is used to enter into the command prompt. • wq command is used to save and quit the file. Copy and Paste Data • The yy command is used at the beginning of the data or line to copy. • The numerical value before the command yy is used to indicate the number of lines of data to be copied. • The p command is used to paste the copied data in the required destination. Cut and Paste Data • The dd command is used to cut the data or line. Delete Character, Word, and Line • The x key is used to delete the selected character. • The dw command is used to delete the selected word. • The dd command is used to delete a line of data. Search Word and Character The ? or / key is used to search for any specific string in the vi editor. Jump a Line • The G command is used to jump to the last line. • The gg command is used to move to the first line. Join a Line The J command is used in the current line of data to join it with the next line of data. Navigate Through Files The following keyboard characters are used to move around the file: • h is used to move left • j is used to move down • k is used to move up • l is used to move right grep and egrep Command • grep stands for global regular expression print and is used to find the pattern in a given file. • egrep stands for extended global regular expressions print. • egrep is faster than grep. grep and egrep Command The following options can be used along with grep command to perform the mentioned tasks: Option Description -o Output the matched parts of a matching line -v Invert the match -c Display the count of matching lines -l Display the list of filenames -n Display the matched lines and their line numbers Key Takeaways Vi editor is also the default editor in Linux distributions. The number at the beginning of the yy command describes the number of lines that need to be copied. The dw command is used to delete a word. grep stands for global regular expression print.

Types of Repositories • Main • Restricted • Universe • Multiverse The four types of repositories to download software from are: This is a community-supported open-source software. Canonical will not support this in terms of providing updates for this release software. Types of Repositories Main Restricted Universe Multiverse This is the default repository and all the packages in this are free. This is a closed-source software supported by Canonical for a price till the end of the life cycle of the release. This includes closed-source software, such as adobe flash. It also includes open-source software with some restrictions. Repository Access To access a repository, the system should be connected to the internet. • Select the required repository from the Ubuntu software center console along with the source location. Repository Access • In the next tab, add repository URL into the file /etc/apt/sources.list. • To check for updates and new releases, use the command $ sudo apt-get update. Software with .deb Extension • In case the software packages are released in a .deb file format, there is no need to use the repository commands such as apt or apt-get. • Use the command $ sudo dpkg -i <package name> to directly install the software, and if there are any dependency failures, use the command $ sudo apt-get install -f. Introduction to apt/apt-get Command • The apt command is a CLI command used to download, install, and remove the software packages. • The earlier version of apt command was called apt-get command. • All new releases of Ubuntu have the apt command. Introduction to apt/apt-get Command • Install packages with the syntax: $ sudo apt install <app-package1> <app-package2> • Uninstall packages with the syntax: $ sudo apt <app-package1> • Remove orphaned application packages automatically. o While installing the packages, apt resolves the dependencies automatically. o Similarly, while uninstalling, it removes the critical dependencies of the application automatically. It is done by the command $ sudo apt autoremove. • Search packages with the syntax: $ sudo apt search <keyword>. Some of the frequently used apt commands are to: Update vs. Upgrade Update will check the availability of new versions of a given package, whereas upgrade will update the packages to a new version. Introduction to PPA • Personal Package Archives (PPA) are software packages that are released by the developer without any testing for publishing in the repository. • These are published separately and can be installed from the software center. Key Takeaways Repository can be defined as a central storage area for all software packages. $ sudo apt-get update command is used to check for updates to the software on the system.

Network Controllers Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VPN • A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes a secure, private connection between two devices or two networks, through a public, unsecured network. • Example: An employee who needs access to sensitive company information while traveling may use a VPN to securely connect their laptop to the company network via the Internet. • VPNs may be used for: • Security • Avoiding censorship or filters by connecting to an outside host • Hiding one’s identity by connecting through proxy servers. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Three Types of VPNs • There are three types of VPNs-- • Host-to-Host: One device connects securely to another device • Host-to-Site: One device connects securely to another network, such as a traveling employee establishing a VPN back to their office network. • Site-to-Site: Two or more networks connected via VPN, functioning as if they are the same network. • Site-to-Site VPN connections are usually established by the routers or firewalls at each location. This is a popular solution for companies with more than one physical location, and need to share data as if they are on the same network. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VPN Protocols • VPNs use specific protocols to establish the connection and route traffic through the VPN. • Because VPN connections are referred to as “Tunnels” these are often referred to as “tunneling protocols”. • IPsec – Internet Protocol Security, authenticates and encrypts IP packets at the Network Layer of the OSI model • GRE – Generic Routing Encapsulation, encapsulates many network protocols into one tunnel. • SSL VPN – Secure Sockets Layer, a popular Internet encryption protocol, can be used to create a VPN • PTP/PPTP – Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is an older VPN method combining GRE with PPP (Point to Point Protocol, also called PTP) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Web Services • Web Services are communication channels over the Internet (or, less often, a company’s internal intranet). • Web services communicate using languages such as XML, REST, and SOAP • Secure connections to Web Services are often made using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Unified Voice Services • Networks carry more than just data today – VoIP phone systems, video streaming, videoconferencing, and instant message systems represent a new challenge for network designers and troubleshooters. • Taken together these voice, video, and messaging systems are referred to as Unified Voice Services. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Challenges with Unified Voice Services, Part 1 • Two issues must be addressed to ensure a good user experience using Unified Voice Services: 1. Latency – latency refers to the delay in delivering packets between nodes. In data transfer occasional latency is not a problem, but in voice communication latency can distort or garble voice and video streams or prevent communication altogether. Implementing the QoS protocol as a method to prioritize packets can help to address latency issues. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Challenges with Unified Voice Services, Part 2 2. Bandwidth – video streaming and videoconferencing can use considerably more bandwidth than normal data transfer.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • To communicate properly on a TCP/IP network, a computer needs four things: • A unique IP Address like 192.168.1.95 to identify it on the network. • A Subnet mask like 255.255.255.0. This defines the scope of the local network – requests that fall within the subnet will be handled by the computer itself, not by a gateway. • A Gateway like 192.168.1.1. The computer will send any non-local network requests to this device. • One or more DNS Servers, like 8.8.8.8. These are servers that translate names, such as wikipedia.com, into IP addresses. IP Basics Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Static Addressing • All that information – IP, Subnet mask, Gateway, and DNS – could be manually assigned to each computer. • This can be referred to as having a Static IP • The picture to the right shows manual IP settings in Windows 7 • Using a static IP requires the administrator to keep track of each computer’s settings and ensure no duplicate IP addresses are issued. • If the gateway, DNS servers, or subnet change, each computer or device must be updated manually. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Dynamic Addressing • Almost all devices support DHCP, Dynamic Host Control Protocol • DHCP allows the device to receive an assigned IP address, as well as predefined subnet, gateway, and DNS information, from a DHCP Server – this is referred to as Dynamic addressing or Dynamic IP • DHCP Servers are often a Router or Server • Some devices can choose which information is assigned by DHCP and which is set manually – the image to the right shows the IP, subnet, and gateway set via DHCP and the DNS set manually on a Windows 7 computer Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • The DHCP specification has two functions – an address allocation mechanism, and a communication mechanism for requesting and receiving addresses. • When a DHCP-enabled device first connects to the network, it has no IP and no network information – all it has is its MAC address. • The device sends a special broadcast request over UDP, looking for a DHCP Server. The request includes the device’s hardware address and may include a specific requested IP address. • If a DHCP Server exists on the local network, it will respond with appropriate IP configuration information. If a specific IP was requested, the Server may or may not provide that IP address. How DHCP Works Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The DHCP Command Sequence DHCP Discover DHCP Offer DHCP Request DHCP Ack IP address request IP address offer IP address selection IP address acknowledgment DHCP Client DHCP Server 1 2 3 4 Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The DHCP Server and Relaying • The DHCP Server is generally a router or server on the local network. • When a device requests a DHCP-supplied address, it does so by broadcasting on the local network. • In larger networks where the DHCP server may not be on the local network, a DHCP/BOOTP Relay Agent can be setup to forward DHCP requests to another network and relay DHCP responses back to the local network. • Cisco routers use the term IP Helper to refer to Relay Agents BOOTP is the predecessor to DHCP – it worked similarly but could not dynamically assign addresses. Relaying work the same in both, which is why it’s called a DHCP/BOOTP Relay Agent. ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DHCP Server Configuration The DHCP Server runs as an application on a Windows Server or similar network server, or runs as a function on a Router. Settings for the DHCP Server include: • Scopes – the sequential range of IP addresses the server can give out, also called the Address Pool • Leases – how long the IP assignment is good. Shorter leases mean an IP address won’t be wasted on devices that are no longer on the network, longer leases are less work for the DHCP server. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DHCP Options The following may also be provided by the DHCP Server: • Subnet mask – details the scope of the local network • Gateway – the default gateway for the local network • DNS Server(s) – the default DNS servers for network devices to use • Default Suffix(es) – the default suffix to add when users search a servername (for example, the suffix “ourcompany.local” would find “ftp.ourcompany.local” if a network device looks for “ftp”) • Reservations – reservations allow specific IP addresses to be reserved for specific machines on the network. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. APIPA What happens if there’s no static IP information set, AND no DHCP? • On Windows devices, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) auto-configures the IP settings. • Starts at 169.254.0.1, up to 169.254.255.254 (IPv4) • Uses ARP to verify if IP is assigned elsewhere. • Also called link-local addressing Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Subnet, Gateway, and DNS • The Subnet mask IP setting determines the scope of the local network. A network device can communicate directly with any other network device on the same local network. • The Gateway handles any traffic which is NOT on the local network. So if a network device needs to communicate with another device which is not on the local network, it sends its request to the Gateway. • The DNS server translates network names – representing either local or remote machines – into IP addresses. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Let’s look at how a Windows computer handles name resolution. If a user tries to go to the website “microsoft.com”, the computer follows these steps: 1. Am I microsoft.com? If so, handle the request directly; if not, go to step 2. 2. Is microsoft.com in my Hosts File? If so, use the Hosts File listing to find the IP address for microsoft.com; if not, go to step 3. 3. Query the DNS server(s) to find an address for microsoft.com. If an address is found, use it; if not, go to step 4. 4. Use NetBIOS name resolution to identify the name. NetBIOS name resolution is specific to Microsoft machines on the local network. 5. If none of these produces a result, return an error. Name Resolution Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Hosts File • A Hosts file takes precedence over DNS. • Hosts file is a manually created lists of domain names and their associated IP addresses. • On Windows computers the file is usually c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\lmhosts.sam Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DNS Let’s look at how the Domain Name System (DNS) works on the Internet: • A domain name, such as donutfiesta.com, is registered with a domain name registrar. As part of the domain name registration, at least one (and usually 2 or 3) DNS servers are listed. • These DNS servers host the DNS settings for that domain – any inquiry for any address which ends with “donutfiesta.com” will be passed to these DNS servers for resolution. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DNS settings can include several types of records related to a domain: • “A Record” – this is the default IP address where any traffic for the domain is directed (IPv4) • “MX Record” – this is the Mail eXchange record, any email traffic for the domain is directed to these IP addresses • “AAAA Record” – similar to the A record, the AAAA record is the details of IPv6 address for traffic to the domain. • “CNAME” – also called an alias or Canonical Name record, the CNAME redirects a subdomain such as “ftp.donutfiesta.com” to another server name. • “PTR Record” – Pointer records map an IP address to a hostname, and are primarily used for reverse DNS. DNS Records Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DNS Propagation • Changes to DNS servers do not take effect immediately. • DNS Server information is cached by all DNS servers around the Internet, so a change to the DNS server setting itself can take up to 72 hours to be in effect for all the Internet hosts. • This delay is referred to as the DNS propagation delay. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Dynamic DNS • In some situations, the server referenced in a DNS record may not have a permanent, “static” IP address. • Dynamic DNS services can adjust DNS entries quickly to point to the current IP address of the target machine. • May include a software agent to monitor and report the current IP address to the DDNS server. • RFC 2136 provides a standard method of updating DDNS servers, but runs through DHCP. • Internet DDNS providers offer DDNS services for free or for a fee. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. NAT: Network Address Translation • NAT was created to solve the problem of limited public IP addresses with IPv4, though it has other uses as well. • Before NAT, each device connected to the Internet needed a public IP address. IPv4 uses 32 bits for IP addresses, yielding around 4.29 billion possible addresses. • NAT works like this: your border router has a public IP address, accessible on the Internet. But devices inside your network use private, local IP addresses such as 10.10.10.1 or 192.168.1.50. • NAT translates packets from your private, internal IP addresses at the router, then translates responses back. This allows potentially thousands of devices to share one public IP. Address Translation Certain IP subnets were designated for only private use – these include 10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, and 172.16.x.x through 172.31.x.x. These addresses are not used on the Internet and can be safely used on a local network. ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • SNAT: Static Network Address Translation. SNAT maps each private IP to a designated public IP. This does not help conserve public IP addresses but can be useful for migrating or merging networks. • DNAT: Dynamic Network Address Translation. DNAT maps each private IP to a public IP from a pool of available public IP addresses. • PAT (Port Address Translation) or Overloading: The most common form of NAT, Overloading is DNAT with just one public IP address shared by multiple private IP addresses. Each private IP address is assigned to a port, and outgoing packets from the router are designated for the port associated with the private IP which originated the request. Address Translation Options Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Ports • “Ports” can be visualized as separate connections on a router, but in reality the “Port” designator is specified in the TCP or UDP packet header. • Ports can identify specific services or, through PAT specific devices. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Port Forwarding • Port Forwarding is a function of a router or firewall which can forward packets designated for a specific port or a port range to a specific computer or device. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Proxy Servers • A proxy server makes network requests on behalf of another computer or device. • The proxy server is a “middleman” or intermediary. • Proxies can serve several functions: • Speeding up requests by caching common data at the proxy server • Bypassing content filters, especially geographic filters • Providing content-filtering services • Hiding the identity or attributes of the requesting device • Reverse proxy servers handle incoming requests on behalf of network servers Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Summary • DHCP can dynamically assign IP address, subnet, gateway, and DNS information to network devices. • Manually setting IP, subnet, gateway, and DNS information is referred to as having a static IP. • DHCP scope is the sequential range of IP addresses the server can give out, also called the Address Pool. • A DNS “A Record” is the default IP address where any IPv4 traffic for the domain is directed. • Network Address Translation (NAT) translates packets from your private, internal IP addresses into a shared public IP address at the router.

CIDR • Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) • Replaces Classful addressing for public IPs • More efficient: • Class A address (e.g. 100.x.x.x) reserves 16.5 million addresses. • No way to redistribute unused addresses to other networks. • CIDR provides more granular address distribution. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. CIDR Notation • A CIDR address looks like: • The subnet mask number indicates the number of bits in the subnet mask, in this case: • So 86.1.1.200/24 is a subnet ranging from 86.1.1.1 through 86.1.1.255 • More common: /33 subnet from an ISP, providing 8 public IP addresses 86.1.1.1/24 Network Address / Subnet Mask /24 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 = 255.255.255.0 Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Private Addresses • CIDR helps to conserve the shrinking pool of public IPv4 addresses. • 4.3 billion IPv4 public IP addresses available • 7 billion people • IPv4 Address Exhaustion • Two Solutions: • IPv6 • NAT – Network Address Translation • The Plan: • Let companies use private addresses spaces inside their networks for any devices which need not be accessible from the Internet. • Map communication from those devices onto shared public addresses when communicating outside the network. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. NAT and PAT Network Address Translation (NAT): • Uses designated Private Address Spaces including: • 10.x.x.x • 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 • 192.168.x.x • Non-routing • IP Packets are translated at the edge router • Static NAT maps each private IP to a designated IP • Dynamic NAT maps each private IP to one public IP in an available pool Port Address Translation (PAT) uses port designators to map all private IP addresses onto one shared public IP • Source & and destination port info is retained Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

All rights reserved. APIPA (IPv4) • What happens if there’s no static IP information set, AND no DHCP? • On Windows devices, Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) auto-configures the IP settings. • Starts at 169.254.0.1, up to 169.254.255.254 (IPv4) • Uses ARP to verify IP is unassigned elsewhere. • Also called link-local addressing Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

All rights reserved. Co-existing, IPv4 and IPv6 • IPv4 and IPv6 are NOT compatible (cannot talk to each other) • They *can* co-exist on the same network through: • Dual-stack: routers and other devices on the network use both IPv4 and IPv6 separately • Tunneling: IPv6 is encapsulated in IPv4 packets for transmission across an IPv4 LAN or WAN (6to4 tunneling) • 4to6 tunneling would carry IPv4 packets across an IPv6 network • Tunneling will break if NAT is involved.

Here is a quick recap of what we have learned in this lesson. Summary • Subdividing a large network into a subnetwork is called subnetting. • The Host Address is the portion of the IP address unique to the host. • Class C addresses started with 192 through 223 in the first octet, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. • CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing which replaced Classful addressing for public IPs. • Port Address Translation (PAT) is a form of Network Address Translation (NAT) which uses port designators to map all private IP addresses onto one shared public IP. • Stateless Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) allows IPv6 hosts to configure its own IP address using Neighbor Discovery Protocol and a modified EUI-64 version of its MAC address.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Explain the purpose of routing protocols. Describe the difference between distance vector, link state, and hybrid routing protocols. Discuss the use of routing tables with static and dynamic routes. Define routing metrics such as distance (hops), MTU, bandwidth, and costs. Explain administrative distance. Label RIPv2, BGP, OSPF, and IS-IS as distance vector, link state, or hybrid protocols. Define route aggregation and route redistribution. Discuss strategies to maintain high availability with regards to routing. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Routers • Small networks usually have just one router. • Larger networks may have many routers to: • Break up broadcast domains • Connect remote locations • Separate logical divisions/departments Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Routing Tables • Each Router creates and maintains a Routing Table to determine which interface will be used for each packet being routed. • At a minimum, each network identified is listed with an associated interface and one or more metrics. • If the same network is available through multiple interfaces, the interface with the best route (metrics) is used. • Routing Tables can be constructed manually (static) or automatically (dynamic). • If a Table contains both static and dynamic entries, the static entries are prioritized. • A default route can be programmed for networks not listed in the table. Routing Table 192.168.1.0 E0 0 192.168.2.0 S0 0 192.168.3.0 S0 1 192.168.4.0 S0 2 Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Dynamic Routes • Calculating the best route dynamically requires work from the router. • Best routes can be calculated based on various routing metrics, including: • Hop count (how many routers away is it?) • MTU, bandwidth (packet size and speed) • Latency (how fast does the next router respond?) • Costs (set by administrator) • Administrative distance – a measurement of perceived quality of a route, based on the routing protocol and/or source of the routing table data, measured from 1 to 255. • SPB – Shortest Path Bridging, 802.1aq. SPB is a newer technology intended to simplify the configuration of networks while enabling multipath routing. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Routing Loop • Router A has a packet to send to Router C. • Its routing table tells that sending to Router B is the best route, so it does so. • Router B checks its routing table for the best route to Router C, and finds it’s through Router A; so it sends the packet back to A. • This is a Routing Loop • Most routing protocols work to avoid loops • Looping packets will generally be dropped when they’ve traversed more than 15 routers. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Interior vs. Exterior • Routing protocols can be classified as Interior or Exterior Gateway Routing Protocols (IGRP or EGRP) • Interior means within a given Autonomous System (AS) – a collection of networks and subnets under the same administrative control. • Exterior means outside a given AS, also outside of your designated network domain. • If an AS is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to present its clearly defined routing policy to the Internet, it will have an Autonomous System Number (ASN). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Distance Vector Routing Protocols • Distance Vector protocols use distance – measured in hops – to calculate the best route. • Each router shares its routing table with neighboring routers, who merge it with theirs and share again. • The time it takes for all routers to finish merging their tables is called convergence. • Distance Vector Routing Protocols include: • RIP (Routing Information Protocol) • RIPv2 (recommended for small networks) • IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Link State Routing Protocols • Link State Protocols (also called Path First Protocols) create three separate tables for direct neighbors, the network topology (including best path and backup path to each network), and a routing table. • Link State protocols include: • OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) • IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) • Both divide networks into “Areas” for faster processing. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Hybrid Protocols • Hybrid protocols combine elements of Distance Vector and Link State routing protocols. • EIGRP (Enhanced IGRP) – includes the subnet mask along with the route updates, supports CIDR and IPv6. • BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) – the main routing protocol of the Internet, can also be used in local networks. Measures 10 attributes of all connected networks, including distance. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Route Redistribution – the translation that occurs when different parts of a network use different routing protocols. • Route Aggregation – minimizing routing tables by consolidating multiple routes into a single route advertisement. • Loopback Interface – a logical, virtual interface in a router, used by OSPF, BGP, and other protocols to maintain communication when physical interfaces are down. Other Terms Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. High Availability • Networks should be designed to resist any single point of failure – a feature known as High Availability. • A virtual IP and virtual MAC address is created for a redundant group of routers. • One router is designated “Master”, the others are designated “Backup”. Master assumes the virtual IP and MAC on a virtual interface. • Hosts on the network use the virtual IP/MAC for their Gateway. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss the network planning process. • Explain how environmental limitations such as distance and EMI/RFI interference sources affect your network plan. • Describe types of equipment that might be segmented for compatibility purposes. • List three considerations of planning a wireless network. • Discuss reasons to include or not include 802.1x and posture assessment in the planned security for your network. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Implementing a Network • Let’s say you are tasked with creating a new network. • What data do you need to design the network appropriately? • How to get started? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. List of Requirements • Start with a list of requirements for the network, provided by the stakeholders including senior management, IT directors, and key users. • If a list of requirements isn’t provided, request one. The list of requirements should include things like: • Software applications to be used • Network services such as VoIP, video conferencing, or database applications • Any special needs such as ICS/SCADA systems or medianets. • Any specific security concerns. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Device Types and Requirements • Consider the quantity and type of devices that will need to use your network. PCs, servers, printers, industrial equipment, tablets, smartphones, and any other devices should be considered. • As a rule of thumb, double the expected quantity of devices which will use the network. If the total is greater than 50 devices, consider segmenting the network into subnets to minimize broadcast traffic. • Will there be any devices with particular network requirements, such as videoconferencing or SCADA networks? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Environmental Limitations • Keep in mind environmental limitations as you map out your network. In particular: • Copper wiring generally has a limitation of 100m – longer distances need to be broken up with switches or repeaters, or carried via fiber optic. • Wireless coverage should be mapped out with a site survey to look for dead spots. • Are there any unusual EMI or RFI sources which should be factored in? • Is there sufficient electrical power in the data room or network closet where key network infrastructure will be housed? • Consider redundant power sources or battery backups for critical network components. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Compatibility Requirements • Think about any potential compatibility issues within your planned network. • If you are implementing IPv6, does all your equipment support it? • Are there older legacy devices which require special connections or which should be segmented into their own network for security considerations? • If your network will include ICS or medianets, consider segmenting those for better performance and security. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wired and Wireless considerations • If there is existing wiring, is it of a sufficient grade to support your planned network speeds? (e.g. Cat5e or better if 1000Mbps) • As a general rule, wired connections are preferable whenever feasible for non-mobile devices. • If multiple wireless access points are needed, consider implementing a mesh network for reliable coverage and/or 802.1x for centralized authentication. • If guests may need access to Internet or network services while at your location, consider implementing a guest WLAN and/or guest VLAN to keep their access away from secure network areas. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Security Considerations • Attention to security should be part of every step in your network planning process. • There is no such thing as “too secure”, though security considerations must be balanced against your budget and your user experience. • Think about your most likely vulnerabilities (outside hackers, malware, rogue users) and focus on hardening the network against those attacks. • Functions such as Posture Assessment and 802.1x authentication are great but may not be feasible for smaller organizations due to lack of budget or other resources.

WAN Technologies WAN: Wide Area Network is often the network your Internet Service Provider uses to connect your LAN to the Internet. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Fiber vs. Copper vs. Wireless A WAN can be delivered many ways, which may include traditional copper cabling, fiber optic cabling, wireless solutions, or a combination. The type of media used may be based on these factors: ● Signal Attenuation/Degradation: The longer the distance a signal travels, the weaker it becomes. The maximum range for a copper DSL circuit is 5.5km while a fiber SONET circuit can travel up to 15km. ● Cost: Generally fiber optic cabling is the most expensive and most difficult to install. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Multiplexing, Time or Frequency • Multiplexing is a procedure for transmitting many signals on the same connection. The combined signals are demultiplexed on the receiving side. • Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) sends each individual signal within a non-overlapping frequency sub-band on the communications medium. • Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) chops each individual signal into discrete chunks, which are transmitted over a synchronized connection. Each chunk uses the connection for a fraction of time. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies - Dialup ● Maximum speed 56Kbps ● Generally obsolete except in rural areas ● Uses a Modem and an analog phone line, often referred to as either: o PSTN—Public Switched Telephone Network o POTS―Plain Old Telephone Service Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies - ISDN ISDN • Consists of 2 or more Bearer channels (“B channels”) capable of carrying 64kbps each, plus one Data channel (“D channel”) at 16kbps. • PRI-ISDN consists of 30 B channels for a total bonded bandwidth of 1920kbps. • BRI-ISDN, most common in North America, uses 2 B channels for a total bonded bandwidth of 128kbps. • Often used for video conferencing systems and phone service, less often for Internet connections. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DSL • “Digital Subscriber Line” • DSL allows high speed data transmission over short distances using ordinary 2-wire telephone cabling. • Because DSL uses frequencies outside of those used for voice traffic, it does not interfere with normal phone calls on the same cable. • DSL circuits must connect to a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (“DSLAM”) within approximately 18,000 feet (5.5 km). WAN Technologies - DSL Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • ADSL • ADSL or Asynchronous DSL has a faster download speed than its upload speed. • ADSL speeds are often written as Upload/Download. E.g. “768/128” indicates an ADSL connection with a 768kbps download speed and 128kbps upload speed. • SDSL • Synchronous DSL: upload speeds and download speeds are identical DSL Types Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Broadband Internet Service uses coaxial cable, generally the same cable used for TV service. • Compared with DSL, Broadband Cable is generally faster but can have higher Latency. • Broadband Cable users share bandwidth with all other users on their local loop. • (DSL users share bandwidth at the shared DSLAM). WAN Technologies – Broadband Cable Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies - Satellite Satellite • Satellite is an option for Internet (and other) connectivity in areas not served by other broadband options. • Satellite speeds have improved but satellite broadband is generally slower than DSL or Cable. • Satellite suffers from extremely high latency – not surprising since transmissions must go into space and back! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies – T-Series and E-Series T-Series and E-Series • T-1 is a type of “leased line” phone and data circuit provided by phone companies in North America. • Originally built for combining multiple voice lines on one circuit, T1s combine 24 64k channels (DS0). • Each channel can carry an analog voice call or be used for data. • 24 channels of 64kbps each *should* yield bandwidth of 1.536 Mbps, however a full T1 bandwidth is 1.544 Mbps due to one extra frame bit sent for synchronization after every 192-bit frame. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. T-Series and E-Series • T-2 and T-3 are larger versions of the T-1. • T-2 is very uncommon, but T-3 is the equivalent of 28 T-1s, with total bandwidth of 44.736 Mbps. • Together, T-1s and similar circuits are referred to as the T-Series. • In Europe a very similar standard is the E-Series. • E-1 connections use thirty-two 64k channels for a total bandwidth of 2.048 Mbps. • The E-3 connection can reach speeds of 34.368Mbps, the equivalent of 16 E-1s. WAN Technologies – T-Series and E-Series (contd.) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. T-Series and E-Series • Despite being slower and often much more expensive than ADSL or Cable connections, T-1 circuits are still very common in businesses for three reasons: • Reliability – T-1 circuits often have very strong Service Level Agreements (SLAs) from the provider, guaranteeing uptime, bandwidth, latency, and packet loss. • Speed – Despite being slower than most DSL or Cable circuits, T-1s are dedicated circuits, not shared with other customers on the local loop (cable) or at the DSLAM (DSL). • Suitability – While modern phone systems may work with IP-based telephone services, many legacy phone systems are designed to work with PRI interfaces (provisioned through a T-1 or ISDN) or single analog lines (PSTN). WAN Technologies – T-Series and E-Series (contd.) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Metro Ethernet (Metro-E) • A WAN technology using plain Ethernet. • Not widely available, but often faster and less expensive than comparable broadband offerings when available. • Often designed as Ethernet to MPLS then back to Ethernet on the remote side. WAN Technologies – Metro E Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies – SONET/SDH SONET/SDH • Synchronous Optical NETwork (US) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (International) • Standard for Synchronous data transmission over fiber optic cables • The SONET basic data rate is 51.84Mbps, called the Optical Carrier Level or OC. • Fiber optic speeds are measured in multiples of OC: • OC-3 = 155.52 Mbps • OC-12 = 622.08 Mbps Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) • WDM is a technique for multiplexing multiple OC signals on a single fiber by using separate wavelengths of light for each. • Individual signals are multiplexed onto the carrier fiber, then demultiplexed back into the original signals at the other end. • This allows network carriers to effectively add more optical “circuits” without the necessity of adding additional lines. • Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is highly efficient, with more than 8 active wavelengths per fiber. • Coarse Wavelength Division Mutiplexing (CWDM) is less efficient, with fewer than 8 active wavelengths per fiber, but is considerably less expensive compared to DWDM. WAN Technologies - WDM Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Frame Relay • A packet switched technology that allows different customers to use the same network at the same time using individual virtual circuits (Permanent or PVC) or (Switched or SVC). • A portion of the available bandwidth is guaranteed to each user, but additional bandwidth can be used if available. • Committed Information Rate (CIR): The maximum bandwidth guaranteed for a particular user. • Access Rate: The maximum speed the Frame Relay interface can transmit. WAN Technologies – Frame Relay Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. MPLS • Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a mechanism to route packets through a large network based on short path labels rather than network addresses. • MPLS works with any protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.) • MPLS can work over most communication technologies, including DSL, T1, ATM, Frame Relay, and IP. • MPLS can improve network traffic by minimizing routing – nodes within the MPLS cloud transfer packets based on their short path label rather than having to perform a routing lookup. • Because MPLS serves some functions at OSI layer 2 and layer 3, it’s considered a “Layer 2.5” technology. WAN Technologies - MPLS Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. WAN Technologies - PPP PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) • PPP is a Data Link protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. • PPP works over dialup, serial cables, ISDN & T1 circuits, or SONET. • PPP-over-Ethernet or PPPoE is often used with DSL connections. • Multilink PPP bonds the underlying physical connections into one virtual pipe, so that three T1 connections at the Physical Layer are seen as a single 4.5Mbps path to a Layer 3 router. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. ATM • Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM): a communications standard designed in the 1980’s to accommodate both high throughput transmissions, such as file downloads, and real-time, low- latency content such as voice calls or video conferencing. • Uses elements of both Circuit Switching and Packet Switching: • Transmits small, fixed-size “cells” (similar to packets) using Time Division Multiplexing. • Establishes a virtual circuit which is either fully dedicated (permanent) or switched. • Being replaced by IP-only Networks WAN Technologies - ATM Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching • Circuit Switching: implementing a network connection via a dedicated communications channel. • For the duration of the communication session, the circuit is 100% dedicated to the network connection. • Traditional Analog phone calls are circuit-switched connections. • Packet Switching: transmitting multiple network connections over a single medium. • Each communications steam is broken into packets, with appropriate header information to be delivered properly on the other end of the medium. • The Internet is a packet-switched network.

Baseband vs Broadband • Baseband: When all the bandwidth of a physical media is used by one signal. • Ethernet is a baseband technology, e.g. “100baseT” • Broadband: When the bandwidth of a physical media is shared by multiple signals. • Example: Cable or DSL-based internet service Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Bitrate vs Baud rate • Baud Rate: In the 1970s and 1980s, the speed of telephone modems was expressed as Baud Rate • Named for French engineer Jean-Maurice-Emily Baudot • Measures electronic state changes per second: 1200 baud = 1200 voltage changes on a physical line in one second. • Originally Baud rate = Bitrate. • The term became unclear when modems began transmitting multiple bits per state change. • Bit Rate: The number of bits transmitted per second. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Sampling Size • When converting analog to digital or vice-versa, the Sampling Size determines the number of times the analog signal is measured at regular intervals. • Higher Sampling Size yields a more precise measurement and more accurate data. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wavelength • The Wavelength of a signal is the measurement of the spatial period of the wave – the distance between the repetitions of the wave. • Wavelength in networking most commonly applies to: • Fiber Optic cabling, where data is transmitted as wavelengths of light. • Wireless networks, where data is transmitted as wavelengths on a radio frequency. wavelength Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Collisions • Collision: When multiple devices share one physical medium, and two or more devices attempt to transmit at the same time. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Collisions (contd.) • Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is the method which Ethernet and other wired technologies use to minimize Collisions and their associated problems. • Host checks for the presence of another signal before and during transmission • If another transmission is detected, Host broadcasts a jam signal to alert all devices to the collision. • Host waits for a randomly generated amount of time, then attempts retransmission. • Also referred to as CDMA/CD for “Carrier Detect Multiple Access”, though CDMA is also an unrelated WAN technology. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Collisions (contd.) • Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is an alternative to CSMA/CD. • Superior to CSMA/CD on Wireless Networks because: • Wireless devices cannot easily detect signals while they are transmitting • Wireless devices may communicate with an Access Point but not be able to receive transmissions from other devices connected to the same Access Point (the “Hidden Node” problem). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Collisions (contd.) • In CSMA/CA: • A node listens to the shared medium to determine when the medium is not in use by other nodes. (Note – this may be inaccurate due to “Hidden Nodes”) • The node then sends an RTS, “Request To Send” signal to the Access Point (or receiver). • If clear, the Access Point will issue a CTS, “Clear To Send” signal back to the requesting node. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Collisions (contd.) • The node then sends an entire Frame, and waits for the Access Point to acknowledge correct receipt of the Frame. • If no acknowledgement is received, the node assumes a collision has occurred, waits for an exponentially- increasing backoff period, then tries again.

All rights reserved. RG Cables and Connectors RG-59/U and RG- 6 are popular types of coaxial cables • Coaxial cables have two conductors: an inner wire and an outer tubular conducting shield • The coax design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) from outside sources, and also minimizes the EMI generated by the cable itself Why “RG”? RG or “Radio Guide” classifications began in World War II. The numbers are sequential, meaning “RG-6” was the 6th type of cable, which was assigned an RG designation. ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. RG-59 vs. RG-6 RG-6 is the most commonly used coaxial cable type, used for cable television. RG-6, also called RG-6/U for “general utility use”, has these characteristics: • 75 ohm impedance • 18AWG center conductor RG-59 is a thinner, cheaper alternative to RG-6, sometimes used to connect devices such as DVD players to TVs. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • RG-58, also called Thinnet, or cheapernet, was a popular cable type to carry 10base2 Ethernet signals. • RG-8 (“Thicknet”) was used to carry 10base5 Ethernet signals and is also popular in amateur radio setups. RG-58 and RG-8 Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. BNC Connectors • BNC connectors are used by older 10base2 networks, and by some video connections. • BNC stands for “Bayonet Neill-Concelman” Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved.

All rights reserved. Things You CAN See There are some things you can see with your eyes on a network, like: • Disconnected cables • The IP address in a configuration window • Link Indicator lights • Smoke, fire, and physical damage Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Things You CAN’T See • Network activity • Outside hackers snooping through your files • Unusual network traffic • Network bottlenecks • Security vulnerabilities Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Monitoring Tools Network monitoring tools give you insight into what is really happening on your network. These can include: • Packet Sniffers (aka Packet or Network Analyzers) • Port Scanners • Interface Monitoring Tools • SNMP Management Tools • Power and Environmental Monitoring Tools • Wireless Survey and Analyzer Tools Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Packet Sniffers Packet Sniffers (aka Packet Analyzers or Network Analyzers) provide insight into packets on the local network. • Sniffers work by capturing all packets transmitted across the network interface • Promiscuous Mode allows the capture of all packets, not just ones sent to or from the local machine (if supported) • Packet Sniffer programs are limited to traffic on the local segment • Packet Sniffer devices can intercept packets in other segments (e.g. between the router and firewall) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Packet Sniffers (contd.) • Captured packets can include just header information or the entire packet • Decoded header info can be useful to identify: • Network problems • Intrusion attempts • Network misuse • Top Talkers (devices that send the most) • Top Listeners (devices that receive the most) Common Packet Sniffer applications include Wireshark, NetMon, and Packet Peeper ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Packet Flow Monitoring • Cisco routers and some independent tools use a function called NetFlow to do Packet Flow Monitoring. • A “Flow” is an aggregated set of packets between two devices and use the same service, protocol, and ports. • Packet Flow data can show the source of network traffic and congestion. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Port Scanners A Port Scanner scans one IP address, or a range of IP addresses, looking for open ports. Some Port Scanners can scan an IP range looking for a specific open port, sometimes called Port Sweeping. Port Scanning is generally done for one of the two reasons: • To scan someone else’s system, trying to find a way into their system • To scan your own system, to make sure there are no openings that might give others access. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Interface Monitoring Other network interface monitoring tools can provide: • Network performance • Device discovery • Interface connections and resets • Packet drops • Link speed and duplex setting Useful network monitoring tools include Solarwinds, ManageEngine, NetMon (Windows), and Network Utility (Mac) ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) • A fundamental part of Internet Protocol (IP), SNMP functions at the Application Layer • Allows parameters on the network device to be read and/or set by Network Management Station (NMS) • Most (but not all) network devices support SNMP • Support may be unidirectional (read only) or bidirectional (read and write) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Information available via SNMP is stored in a tree of data called Management Information Base (MIB) • Each individual variable stored is referred to as an Object Identifier or OID, which looks like “1.4.6.1.3.866.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.3.2757.3” • Some devices have dozens or hundreds of OIDs, some have just a few. • The command to retrieve an OID from the MIB is called GET • To retrieve all OIDs in a MIB tree, a WALK command is used which uses GET and GETNEXT in sequence to retrieve all available SNMP data SNMP (contd.) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. SNMP (contd.) • Trap is an alert generated via SNMP on a managed device, sent to a Network Management Station (NMS), in response to predetermined criteria being met in one or more OIDs. • Typical OIDs: • Link speed • Duplex • Network address • System name • Uptime • Port statuses (for routers/switches) • Page count and ink status (for printers) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Alerts Alerts provide timely information about current network issues, security issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits. Alerts can be generated by SNMP traps, Interface Monitoring applications, or other network management tools. Alerts can be sent via: • Email • SMS Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Syslog • A Syslog server can collect messages from routers and other network devices. • Messages are aggregated, searched, and stored on the Syslog server. • Benefits: • No need to manually check each device • Log files can be stored indefinitely • Data from all network devices can be reviewed together Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. SIEM Security information and event management (SIEM) is a general term for software products and/or services combining security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). SIEM tools aggregate data from multiple network devices and applications, to provide: • Data correlation and alerting • Dashboards • Legal compliance and retention support • Forensic support SIEM is sometimes used interchangeably with SIM and SEM. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Environmental and Power Monitoring Three environmental elements can affect network operations and may need to be monitored: • Temperature – warm temperature in any given device may cause the device to fail or perform erratically. • Humidity – high humidity can cause corrosion in equipment, while low humidity can cause static electricity to build up and cause ESD problems • Power – a steady, stable flow of electricity, without dips, surges, and outages, is essential to keep computer equipment running smoothly. Monitoring devices for Temperature, Humidity, and Power can be integrated into any network monitoring system. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Survey Tools / Wireless Analyzers Wireless Analyzers – analyze Wi-Fi signals to determine channels in use, signal strength, bandwidth used, top talkers, and in some cases can also perform packet sniffing functions. Wireless Survey Tools – analyze signal strength and coverage area of wireless transmitters to help determine placement and troubleshoot problem areas. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Lesson 2-2: Metrics and Reports Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Describe the importance of reports and metrics • Explain the meaning and purpose of a baseline • Define a bottleneck • Discuss the purpose of log management • Explain utilization and its role in removing bottlenecks • Describe attributes that may be reported by interface monitoring Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Working With Reports and Metrics Network servers, monitoring tools, and many network devices can produce logs and reports. Quantifiable data such as capacity, utilization, and bandwidth that are produced by reports or other sources are called metrics. Understanding how to read reports and analyze metrics is an important part of being a network administrator. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Baseline Reporting starts with having a Baseline – a measurement of performance under “normal” conditions. Baselines provide a basis for comparison in future reports. Creating a Baseline is called Baselining. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Bottleneck Bottleneck--A point of congestion in a system that occurs when workloads arrive at a given point more quickly than that point can handle them. Addressing the bottleneck is the most efficient way to improve performance in any system. Bottlenecks are usually related to speed or bandwidth. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Log Management Log management refers to dealing with large volumes of computer-generated log messages (also known as audit records, audit trails, event-logs, etc.) Log Management includes • Log collection • Centralized aggregation • Long-term retention • Log rotation (rename, compress, delete) • Log analysis (in real-time and in bulk after storage) • Log search and reporting. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Utilization One of the most important metrics derived from logs and reports is Utilization–how much of a resource is being used. High utilization indicates a resource may be insufficient and is causing a bottleneck. Utilization is often measured for: • Bandwidth (across any segment or total) • Storage • Network device CPU • Network device memory • Wireless channel utilization Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Graphing Utilization and some other metrics are easier to understand in a graph rather than comparing a number to a baseline. Graphs usually show values over time, such as bandwidth or CPU utilization. Graphing tools are often included in network monitoring devices and applications. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Link Status Link status typically refers to a visual indicator that is favorable, neutral, or unfavorable. • Green is favorable/connected • Yellow or Red indicates issues • Off indicates disconnected Link Status can be checked visually on the device or, for many devices, via a dashboard or via SNMP Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Interface Monitoring Most managed network devices include a function to monitor their interface. This is often done via an online dashboard or control panel, which provides insight into the device’s status. Attributes monitored can include: • Link Status • Errors • Utilization • Discards • Packet drops • Interface resets • Speed and duplex Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved.

Lesson 2-3: Configuration Management Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss configuration management. • Describe the use of backups and archives in configuration management. • Explain how a baseline is used in configuration management. • Discuss issues related to on-boarding and off-boarding mobile devices. • Explain the benefit of Network Access Control (NAC) • Describe the following types of configuration documentation: Network Diagram, Asset Management, IP address utilization, Vendor Documentation, Internal Operating Procedures/Policies Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Configuration Management Network Devices have many settings – speed, duplex, WAN info, LAN info, DNS info, IP schema, port settings, routing and forwarding instructions, etc. Configuration Management refers to managing the configuration of network devices and applications in your network. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Archives and Backups Data backups are essential. Configuration backups are also critical, but they are often overlooked. • Routers, firewalls, and other network devices generally provide a function to backup all configuration information to a backup file. • In the event of a hardware failure or replacement, the configuration file can be used to reprogram a replacement device with the original configuration. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Archives and Backups (contd.) Backups refer to an operational set of configuration files that can be used to reprogram equipment in the event of a hardware failure or replacement. Archives refer to multiple backups stored over a long period of time, so that prior configurations can be reviewed if needed. The terms are often used interchangeably. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Baselines We previously discussed baselines (a snapshot of “normal” functions) and baselining as it applies to network reports and metrics. Baselines are also critical for configuration management, especially when troubleshooting. Troubleshooting 101 – if it used to work, and now it doesn’t work, and nothing changed, something broke. Baselines verify the “nothing changed” element. Baseline configurations may be part of network documentation, or saved configuration files, or both. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Mobile Devices • A growing area of IT management relates to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) and how they can be configured for an organization’s’ network. • This is referred to as Mobile Device Management (MDM). • Some organizations allow users to connect their personal mobile devices to the network – this is called Bring Your Own Device or BYOD. • MDM On-boarding determines how mobile devices are connected to the network, including what access they are granted. • MDM Off-boarding removes network settings and any organization-specific settings when a mobile device will no longer be used on the network. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Access Control (NAC) Network Access Control (NAC) is an extra layer of protection, implemented in some networks, which determines if a device is secure before granting access to the network. Posture Assessment – this is a check that determines if a device meets the criteria to connect to the network. This includes verifying if the device has up-to-date virus protection, OS security updates, disk encryption, and other protections. The Posture Assessment is performed by an agent on the device, which can be persistent (installed, always available) or non- persistent (runs at the time of connection but not permanently installed). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Documentation The key to configuration management is documentation. Up-to-date, easily accessible, and easy-to-read documentation will make it easier to check configurations settings when needed. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Documentation (contd.) Good documentation may include: • Network diagrams (logical/physical) – drawings representing the cabling and device connections for the entire network. • Asset management – a list of all network devices with key specifications and details. • IP address utilization – a list of all assigned IP addresses and/or DHCP pools used by each device. • Vendor documentation – manuals and service information for any key network devices, including serial numbers and service contract details if applicable. • Internal operating procedures/policies/standards Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Domain 2: Operations CompTIA Network + Exam Prep (N10-006) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Lesson 2-4: Network Segmentation Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Define network segmentation. • Discuss how performance optimization, security, compliance, and compatibility can benefit from network segmentation. • Explain why SCADA systems, legacy systems, and public networks should be segmented. • Describe honeypots and honeynets. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Segmentation Large networks are often separated by switches, routers, or bridges into segments. Each segment is its own collision domain: • CSMA/CD functions only within the local segment. • Traffic identified as being on the local segment is not transmitted outside of the segment. • Broadcast traffic without a specific destination and traffic whose destination is not within the local segment will be transmitted outside the segment. • If a router is used to separate the segment, then broadcast traffic will remain within the segment as well (broadcast domain segmentation). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Segmentation (contd.) There are three reasons for segmenting a network: 1. Performance Optimization – segmenting local traffic and CSMA/CD requests reduces traffic across the rest of the network (especially in Medianets) and potentially contains problems (e.g. jabber). • Load Balancing – part of Performance, load balancing refers to adjusting equipment to prevent overloading any one component such as a router or switch. Segmenting networks can be a big part of load balancing. 2. Security – restricting data flow to local segments makes it harder for hackers to access other parts of the network. • Compliance – part of Security, when data is subject to specific compliance regulations, particularly finance or privacy related, segmenting that data makes compliance and compliance reporting easier. 3. Compatibility – some network segments may use incompatible technologies. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Networks That Should Be Segmented • SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) – used in industrial settings, SCADA networks control industrial equipment. To prevent interference with machine operation, SCADA networks should be segmented from other general networks. • Legacy Systems – Legacy computer systems are not uncommon in business. These are often outdated and insecure, but still required to manage one or more business-critical applications. Because they lack modern antivirus and security settings, legacy systems should be segmented. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Networks That Should Be Segmented (contd.) • Public/Private networks – Many organizations offer a “guest” network to allow visitors access to the Internet and perhaps less confidential areas of their main network. The public, guest network should be its own segment. • Testing Labs – Testing labs may include secure subnets where developers test new software or IT consultants prepare new equipment or test potentially infected equipment. • Medianets – The high bandwidth demands of audio and video traveling on a medianet will almost always have negative effects on the rest of the network if they are not placed on their own segment. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Honeypots and Honeynets • Honeypots are computers designed to be attractive to intruders. The goal is for intruders to focus their attention on one or more honeypots rather than the organization’s real data. • Honeynets are entire network segments constructed as an attractive target for outside intruders. • Honeypots and Honeynets should obviously be segmented from the rest of the network, with appropriate coverage by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. QUIZ a. b. c. d. How can network segmentation be used to enforce role policies? 1 Creating a separate segment for a guest network.

Summary • Large networks are often separated by switches, routers, or bridges into segments. • Reasons why a network might benefit from segmentation include performance optimization, load balancing, security, compliance, and compatibility. • Specific network types that are usually segmented include SCADA, legacy systems, public networks, testing labs, and medianets. • Honeypots are computers designed to be attractive to intruders. Honeynets are entire network segments constructed as an attractive target for outside intruders. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved.

Lesson 2-5: Patches and Updates Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Explain the importance of operating system updates and patches. • Define firmware and firmware updates. • Describe when driver updates are needed. • Explain the difference between major and minor releases. • Describe situations when upgrading or downgrading might be appropriate. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. A Secure Network To be secure, a network can’t remain static. There is strong financial motivation for hackers to find new ways around the protections built into firewalls, routers, servers, and operating systems. Manufacturers regularly release new improved software and security patches to close security holes when they are identified. Patching and updating must be a routine part of all network administration. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Operating System (OS) Updates The most common update is the OS update – applying the updates and patches provided by Microsoft, Apple, or your OS vendor. • Modern operating systems contain between 10 million and 80 million lines of code. • OS updates patch security holes discovered within the code. • Some OS updates also add new features and functionality • OS updates should generally be applied monthly or as directed by the OS vendor Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Firmware Updates Firmware is the onboard instructions on a computer or network device, which control the low level functions and load the Operating System (if applicable). • Firmware updates are issued periodically for computers, routers, firewalls, and managed switches. • Many firmware updates patch security holes discovered in the firmware, or correct known issues. • Network administrators should review all devices on the network for firmware updates periodically. Before any firmware update you should backup any settings in the device, known as a Configuration Backup. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Driver Updates • Drivers are special code that tells the operating system how to communicate with a specific device or hardware component. • Just like firmware and the OS, drivers are periodically updated to correct issues with security, performance, or to fix errors. • The OS will often update its included drivers but may not update third-party drivers. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Vulnerability Patches When vulnerabilities are discovered in an Operating System or firmware, vulnerability patches (aka critical patches/updates, security patches) are often issued very quickly. • Patches that arrive outside the normal patch schedule are called “out-of-band”. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Upgrading vs Downgrading • Upgrading is replacing your current OS or firmware with a newer version. • Generally, upgrading regularly is a good idea. Newer versions may contain new security features and other improvements. • In some cases upgrading can cause compatibility problems with previous apps or hardware devices. • Downgrading is replacing a newer OS or firmware with an older version, and is sometimes necessary for compatibility purposes. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Major vs Minor Releases • A Major Release contains substantial new functionality and bug fixes. • A Minor Release contains bug fixes and minor improvements to existing features. • Most operating systems, drivers, and firmware updates are enumerated with version numbers such as XX.YY.ZZ, where XX is the version, YY is the major release, and ZZ is the minor release. • Major releases and new versions generally include all previously issued minor releases. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. QUIZ a. b. c. d.

Lesson 2-6: VLANs and Switches Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Distinguish between a Broadcast Domain and a Collision Domain • Explain the function of the MAC Forward/Filter Table • Describe the disadvantage of using routers to break up broadcast domains • Describe the benefit of a Virtual LAN (VLAN) • Explain the difference between static and dynamic VLAN assignment • Identify the differences between managed and unmanaged switches • Describe the following switch features: port bonding, port mirroring, loop avoidance • Explain the use and benefits of Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Refresher – Broadcast Domain and Collision Domain On an old-fashioned hub-based IP network, all traffic is delivered to every device. This is a very inefficient system because: • Every time a node transmits, it may collide (send while another node is also transmitting), causing both nodes to have to resend. • Packets intended for a specific device (on or off the network) are sent to every device. • Broadcast packets, such as DHCP requests, network discovery requests, and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests are sent to every device. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The Benefit of a Switch A Switch is an intelligent device which always performs at least two functions: 1. Each port is its own CSMA/CD Collision Domain. 2. As frames are received on each port, the switch makes a forward/flood/filter decision based on a quick reading of the frame’s header information. Some switches will also perform loop avoidance functions. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. MAC Forward / Filter Table Port MAC Addresses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Switch is powered on or reset; table is empty Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. MAC Forward / Filter Table Port MAC Addresses 1 00:0a:95:9b:68:16 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Frame received on port 1 – source MAC address is read from frame header and added to table. Frame is sent to all ports (Flooded) because destination MAC is not in the table. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. MAC Forward / Filter Table Port MAC Addresses 1 00:0a:95:9b:68:16 2 3 4 04:13:a7:01:fe:11 5 6 7 8 Response frame received on port 4 – source MAC address is read from frame header and added to table. Frame is sent to port 1 (Forwarded) because destination MAC is found in the table; no traffic is sent to other ports. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. MAC Forward / Filter Table Port MAC Addresses 1 00:0a:95:9b:68:16 2 A4:32:cc:05:ed:81 3 00:0a:95:9b:69:a0 4 04:13:a7:01:fe:11 5 00:0a:95:9b:69:33 6 01:77:ab:b1:43:19 03:2e:1f:56:2a:3e 05:23:a2:0a:d7:05 7 8 Over time as the table is built, more frames are hopefully Forwarded than Flooded, reducing network traffic. Table entries are reset after a period of time. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Broadcast Traffic Three types of information are sent on each port of a switch: • Frames intended for a device on that port • Frames intended for a device which is not in the forward/filter table of the switch • Broadcast traffic – all switch segments are part of the same broadcast domain Broadcast traffic includes administrative information such as DHCP requests, ARP requests, and network discovery requests. As the network size increases, broadcast traffic becomes a bigger problem. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Segmenting Broadcast Traffic • Routers break up broadcast domains • Disadvantages: • Expensive • Require separate physical networks Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Another Option: VLAN • A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a virtually separated network, spanning one or more switches • Requires a switch (usually managed) with VLAN support Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VLAN: Static vs Dynamic • Ports on a switch are assigned to a specific VLAN (access link) or to a trunk (trunk link). • The default or native VLAN is the VLAN ports default if not specifically assigned. • Static assignment is when a port is assigned to a specific VLAN. • Alternatively a port can be assigned by a VLAN Membership Policy Server (VMPS) based on the MAC address of the device connected to the port (dynamic assignment). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VLAN Trunk • Individual switch ports are designated as “Access” or “Trunk” ports. • Access ports behave exactly like normal switch ports, for their designated VLAN. • Trunk ports aggregate all VLAN data to send to another switch or router using VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP). • Frames are tagged with VLAN identifier • ISL and 802.1q are popular VLAN tagging protocols. • VLAN tags are removed before packets are sent through access links Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VLAN Characteristics • VLANS operate entirely separately – no traffic is passed from one VLAN to another through the switch. • To connect traffic between two VLANs a router must be used. • VLANs are usually setup on unique subnets to allow potential routing. • Hosts on a VLAN are unaware they are on a VLAN. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. VLAN Trunks and Aggregation • A trunk carries tagged traffic for multiple VLANs between compatible switches or routers. • To improve bandwidth, port bonding (aka link aggregation or link bundling) can be used to combine two or more port connections between devices. • Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is commonly used to bundle disparate physical ports into one logical connection. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Port Mirroring • There are situations when it would be beneficial to access the packets being transmitted by a switch port: • When using a packet sniffer to troubleshoot network issues, or • When using an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to watch for signs of intrusions. • Port Mirroring duplicates all transmissions on a specific switch port to another designated port (Switched Port ANalyzer or SPAN) • Some switches can mirror a local port to a port on another compatible switch (Remote Switched Port ANalyzer or RSPAN) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Managed vs Unmanaged • Unmanaged Switches – work automatically, provide basic switch functions without any configuration or IP address. • Managed Switches – • Can be configured from a local console connection (out- of-band management) or remotely (in-band management). • Must have an IP address and default gateway configured for in-band management using a virtual terminal utility such as Telnet Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Managed Switches • Managed Switches – configuration options • Username and Password to administer the switch • VLAN assignment • Port speed (10/100/1000Mbps) • Duplex (Full or Half) • Port Mirroring and Port Bonding settings • Some switches allow configuration via a centralized AAA Server (authentication, authorization, and accounting) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Power over Ethernet • Power over Ethernet (PoE) can eliminate need for a separate power cord for IP devices. • Great for: • VoIP Phones • Wireless Access Points • Remote Cameras • Two standards: • PoE (802.3af): Up to 15.4W • PoE+ (802.3at): Up to 25.5W Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Power over Ethernet (contd.) • Uses unused wire pairs in Cat5 cabling, and/or transmits power over data pairs using common-mode signaling. • PoE may be supplied from the switch or from a separate PoE injector. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Data Loops • Sometimes multiple connections are created (accidentally or on purpose) between two switches. • Except when they are properly configured in a LACP port-bonding scenario, this can create a “broadcast storm”. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Loop Avoidance • Better switches often use loop avoidance strategies based on Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) • STP port states: • Blocked – no forwarding, drops all packets except Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU). “Should I stay blocked?” • Listening -- drops all packets except BPDU. “Should I go to blocked or learning?” • Learning – drops all packets except BPDU, begins to populate the MAC filter/forward table. “Where is everybody?” • Forwarding – normal operation • Disabled -- inoperative • STP uses BPDUs to map the best path to the root switch – alternate paths (loops) are blocked. • Spanning tree (802.1d) requires up to 50 seconds for all ports to reach Forwarding or Blocked states. • Rapid spanning tree (802.1w) simplifies the stages and can complete port election in 15 seconds.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Describe the purpose of wireless routers, access points, and bridges • Explain the use of a heat map • Describe how SSIDs are configured for roaming • Distinguish between ad-hoc, infrastructure, and mesh topologies • Define wireless VLAN and wireless controller • Explain the benefits of a wireless bridge • Describe various ways to improve wireless throughput Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Going Wireless • It’s become the norm for organizations to supply wireless networks for their customers and/or staff. • Wireless networks are used for mobile devices, such as: • Notebook computers • Smartphones • Tablets • Security cameras • Media Devices (Roku, Chromecast, etc.) • Gaming Devices (Xbox, PlayStation) • Wireless networks also may be advantageous for desktop computers or other traditionally wired devices in areas where wiring is unavailable. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Routers For many small office/home office (SOHO) networks, the wireless router is the sole piece of network infrastructure with four functions. • Wireless Access Point – receiver/transmitter to connect wireless devices • Switched LAN ports – provide wired network connectivity • Bridge – connects the WLAN to the LAN • Router – connects your LAN to the WAN Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Access Point • Wireless Access Point (WAP or AP) is a wireless transmitter/receiver without the router and switch functions of the wireless router. • Access Points generally include one LAN port for connection to the wired network. • The number of APs or Wireless Routers needed for a given area depends on: • Device density • Environmental considerations (obstacles, interference) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Heat Map • Identifying the coverage area for all Access Points in a network can be done with a Site Survey. • A Site Survey is the planning and designing of a Wi-Fi network. • Initial placement of APs is based on estimated range, considering walls and other obstacles. • A Heat Map showing actual signal strength can be produced using special software utilities or a dedicated wireless meter. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. SSID • Each Wireless Router or AP is set to broadcast one or more Service Set IDentifiers (SSID). • The SSID is the name given to the wireless network connection at that AP. All devices connected to the same SSID are considered part of a Service Set. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Roaming • When two or more APs use the same SSID, wireless devices will choose which AP to connect to based on signal strength. • The wireless device will periodically re-evaluate which AP to connect to. • This process is called Roaming. • No special setup is required. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Advanced WLAN Management • Configuring one WAP is easy. Configuring dozens of Access Points can be complicated! • A WLAN Server (wireless controller) can configure multiple Access Points from one centralized control panel. • The wireless controller and APs communicate using one of the two popular protocols: • Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) • Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Load Balancing with VLANs • Wireless APs are a Broadcast Domain • To break up congested APs, wireless clients can be assigned to VLANs to create separate broadcast domains. • Some wireless controllers support VLAN Pooling, where multiple VLANs are used on the same AP and with the same SSID • Benefits: • Multiple broadcast domains, less bandwidth wasted with broadcast traffic. • Can use multiple IP address spaces. • VLANs can be designated (for security), or the wireless controller can auto-assign based on load balancing. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Topologies • Ad-Hoc: A wireless network without access points or routers – wireless nodes communicate directly with each other. • Infrastructure: Standard wireless network where nodes connect to a wireless access point or router, which bridges the wireless network to a wired network. • Mesh: A network topology where each access point or each node relays data for the network as a whole. • Wireless mesh networks often use the WDS system to interconnect wireless access points. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Two-Building Problem Two buildings need to share a network – how can you connect them? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Two-Building Problem (contd.) Copper? NO – connecting the buildings with Cat5 or similar cabling can cause electrical problems and destroy equipment due to the difference in potential energy between the buildings (aka ground loop) Fiber Optic?

Network Admission Control Goals Prevent/reduce zero-day attacks Enforce security policy throughout the network Use identities to perform access control Honeypots Enable services and ports Have services emulated A honeypot system is a computer that sits in the screened subnet or the DMZ and attempts to lure attackers. Honeypots Group of honeypots implemented together is called a honeynet. Security Testing Vulnerability Scanning It is a process of examining your systems and network devices for security holes and weaknesses. Vulnerability Scanning Vulnerability scanners are designed to help administrators and address vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Scan Goals • Identify vulnerability • Identify lack of security controls • Identify common misconfigurations Some scanners are capable of remediation checking for misconfigurations. Penetration Testing Emulates the same methods attackers would use Uncovers any weaknesses within the environment Tries to exploit the system The most aggressive form of security testing Simulates an attack from a malicious outsider. Types of Penetration Testing The types depend on the organization, its security objectives, and the management goals. Types of Penetration Testing In black box testing, the tester has no knowledge of the internal design or features of the system. It simulates the external attacker the best. Types of Penetration Testing In white box testing, the tester has complete knowledge of the internal system, it may yield a more complete result, but it may not be representative of an external hacker. It may be a good indicator of an internal type of threat. Types of Penetration Testing In grey box testing, some information about internal working is given to the tester. • Helps guide tester tactics • Mitigates the risks Security Audits Security Audits These are systematic evaluations performed with the purpose of demonstrating the effectiveness of controls to a third party. Security Audits It is performed by independent auditors. Auditors provide unbiased view of the state of security controls. Types of Security Audits • It is performed by an organization’s internal staff. • The reports are intended for internal audience. Disadvantage: Conflict of interest and hidden agenda • It is performed by third-party auditors. • The reports are intended for third-party stakeholders. • NDA is a prerequisite. Disadvantage: Cost Key Takeaways Networks are part of a large, centrally managed, internetworked architecture solutions. Wireless networks are computer networks that are not connected by cables of any kind. Network-based protection or security is a method of preventing your computer network from unauthorized user access. Security testing is a process of examining your systems and network devices for security holes and weaknesses.

All rights reserved. Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity • Disaster Recovery (DR) is a set of policies, procedures and solutions to facilitate recovering from a disaster. • Consider how IT systems, including servers, data, and applications, can be restored after a fire, flood, theft, or equipment failure. • Business Continuity refers to activities and procedures to ensure critical business operations continue during and after a disaster. BDR devices such as the Datto Siris provide special Backup and Disaster Recovery solutions by backing up key servers and virtualizing server operations in case of hardware failure ! Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Battery Backups / UPS • Battery Backups or Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) provide supplemental electricity to servers and other equipment during a power outage. • Battery Backups provide five to sixty minutes of power. • UPS software can notify administrators or automatically initiate shutdown processes. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Single Point of Failure • Single Point of Failure – A single device, connection, or service which will significantly impact network operations if it fails. • In Disaster Recovery planning, IT staff should identify: • Critical nodes – network devices or connections which will disrupt operations if they fail • Critical assets – resources such as servers or data storage locations which will disrupt business operations if they are unavailable • Wherever possible redundancy should be used to eliminate single points of failure in critical nodes or critical assets Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Vulnerability Scanning / Penetration Testing • Vulnerability scanner: A computer program designed to assess computers, computer systems, networks, or applications for weaknesses. • Nessus (paid) and Nmap (free) are two of the most popular vulnerability scanners. • Penetration test: An attack on a computer system with the intention of finding security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to it, its functionality, and data. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Responding to a Data Breach • Data breach – unauthorized access to network data, usually from outside the network. • First responders – the first person to identify a data breach or other unauthorized activity. IT staff should be trained in appropriate first responder techniques, including securing the crime scene as well as documenting and preserving evidence. • End user awareness and training – many data breaches occur due to end user errors, such as opening unexpected email attachments. Adhering to appropriate standards and policies related to acceptable behaviors should be part of end user training. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. QUIZ a. b. c. d.

Lesson 3-2: Attack Vectors Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: Differentiate between brute force and social engineering attacks. Explain a denial-of-service attack. Describe various attack vectors including IP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, session hijacking, and VLAN hopping. Explain wireless attack vectors including evil twin, rogue AP, war driving, and WEP/WPA attacks. Discuss the threat caused by malicious insiders. Describe various ways to reduce your attack surface. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Attack Vectors are any paths by which an intruder can gain access to or cause damage to a computer system or network. • Attack Surfaces are any potentially vulnerable areas of a computer system, which can be targeted by an attack. Attack Vectors Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Brute Force • Brute Force attacks use no special tricks or vulnerabilities to work. • Typical brute force attack – using password cracking tool to try thousands of possible username and password combinations to access a server. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Denial of Service • Any attack which seeks to prevent a server (or other device) from responding to its users. • Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) – an attack where a large number of nodes attempt to communicate with a server at the same time, preventing or delaying the server from responding to normal user requests. • Botnet – a group of computers under the control of a single entity, usually caused by malware, which can be leveraged to implement a DDoS attack or other coordinated attack. • Traffic Spike – often the main indicator of a coordinated attack is a significant spike in the amount of network traffic around a particular server or device. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Denial of Service (contd.) • Reflective attacks – a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that redirects traffic from other servers to overwhelm the target. • Amplification attacks – a reflective DoS attack in which the traffic sent from the reflection source is far greater than the traffic needed to initiate the reflection. • Example: Hacker spoofs the target machine’s IP address and requests DNS or NTP info from one or more “Open Resolver” DNS or NTP servers. • Friendly/Unintentional DoS – when non-malicious traffic overwhelms a server in what appears to be a DoS attack. • Smurfing – a nearly obsolete form of DoS attack involving spoofing an IP address and then sending a PING request to a broadcast address on another network. All devices on the network receive the PING and have to respond, thus flooding the network, but most routers disable this feature on broadcast addresses now. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Physical Attack • Access to a server or network can be prevented by physically damaging the equipment. These attacks can be mitigated by preventing physical access to the equipment. • Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) – a term used when a server or network is permanently disabled by physical attacks, or by causing permanent damage remotely (e.g. damaging the firmware with a remote flash attack, “phlashing”). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Spoofing • Spoofing = pretending. • IP Spoofing – Packet headers are altered so that packets from one device appear to be coming from another IP. • Used as a way to get through filters and firewalls, or as a way to setup other attacks such as a “Man-in-the-middle” attack. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. ARP Cache Poisoning • ARP – Address Resolution Protocol, used to translate IP addresses into MAC addresses. • ARP Cache – a table each device builds and maintains which matches IP addresses to MAC addresses based on ARP packets received (not just ARP packets requested). • ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique by which a local machine sends ARP packets to redirect IP packets intended for another device to itself or to another host. • Only works on the local segment • Also called ARP Spoofing or ARP Poison Routing Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Man-In-The-Middle • A Man-in-the-middle attack occurs when a compromised computer intercepts communication between two hosts by pretending to be the other host. • Can be used to impersonate: • Servers • Critical PCs • Websites • Wireless Access Points • Financial Gateways Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Packet / Protocol Abuse • Imagine a hacker gains control of a key computer and needs to send information outside the network, but the firewall is blocking their TCP packets. • One option: encapsulate TCP packets into DNS protocol packets using a tool such as Iodine. • This is also called Protocol Tunneling. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Other Attacks • Session Hijacking – after two machines authenticate in a session (conversation), the hacker steals the session ID and redirects traffic to replace one of the two original devices in the session. • VLAN Hopping – communicating outside of your designated VLAN by adding a fake VLAN ID tag and communicating over at least two switches. • The first switch passes your packets to the second switch, adding a real VLAN ID. • The second switch removes the real VLAN ID, exposing the fake VLAN ID, which may be routed to the target VLAN. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Social Engineering • Social Engineering refers to using non-technical means to gain access to an otherwise secured network. • Social Engineering techniques may include: • Phone calls • Emails • “Lost” flash drives or other media • Social Engineering is the most difficult threat to defend against. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Attacks • Several attack vectors are unique to wireless networks: • Evil twin – Using a WAP with the same SSID as a legitimate WAP to connect to an organization’s wireless devices for a peer-to-peer attack. • Rogue AP – Any WAP connected to your network but not under your control. • War driving – Scanning for unsecured access points while driving around. • War chalking – Documenting known compromised access points with chalk (or online). • WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPS attacks – attacks to try and break the password on a wireless access point. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Bluetooth Attacks • Bluejacking – sending unsolicited messages to a nearby computer or device via Bluetooth. • Bluesnarfing – intercepting Bluetooth connections or taking control of a device via Bluetooth. • Both can be mitigated by turning off “discoverability” in Bluetooth devices. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Malware • Malware (malicious software, including viruses) can be a factor in network attacks. • Malware infections can potentially: • Collect passwords • Look for files or specific data • Allow hackers remote access into the network Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Insider Threat • The best network protections available are useless if a malicious employee with sufficient access wants to cause harm. • Disgruntled users can: • Erase files and data • Physically damage equipment • Install malware or hacking tools Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Other Terms • Compromised System – any computer or device which is under the control of an intruder. • Zero Day Attack: • when an exploit is discovered in an operating system or program and is used by hackers before a fix is available, or • When a new virus or malware is discovered that is not yet detected by anti-malware defenses. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Vulnerabilities – Reducing Your Attack Surface • Unnecessary running services – turn off • Open ports – block at firewall or on local PC • Unpatched/legacy systems – move to separate subnet, disconnect from internet • Unencrypted channels – don’t use • Clear text credentials – make sure connections are encrypted Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Vulnerabilities – Reducing Your Attack Surface (contd.) • Unsecure protocols – discontinue if possible • TELNET • HTTP • SLIP • FTP • TFTP • SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 • TEMPEST/RF emanation – NATO and NSA certification for spying by measuring unintended emanations.

Supply Chain Risks Compromised software or hardware purchased from suppliers Vulnerabilities in supply chain management or supplier systems Third-party service providers or vendors Poor Information Security practices by lower-tier suppliers Third-party data storage or data aggregators Counterfeit hardware or hardware with embedded malware The supply chain risks are: Supply Chain Countermeasures Presence of robust IT security solutions internally Compliance and governance Certification of international standards Supplier Management Controls It is the process whereby companies monitor and manage interactions with all external parties with which they have a relationship. Personnel Management Personnel Management It refers to planning, organizing, compensation, integration, and maintenance of people for the purpose of contributing to organizational, individual, and societal goals. Personnel Management Skills Responsibility Roles Organizational Culture Case Study: AWS Outage Problem Statement: In May 2017, Amazon faced a big A.W.S. outage that took down a bunch of large internet sites for several hours on a Tuesday afternoon. Case Study: AWS Outage Cause of the problem: In a blog post, the company said that one of its employees was debugging an issue with the billing system and accidentally took more servers offline than intended. That error started a domino effect that took down two other server subsystems and so on. Case Study: AWS Outage This case illustrates the importance of change management and internal governance in organizations. Common IS Program Challenges Inadequate management support Inadequate staffing Inadequate funding Key Takeaways Information security governance is the set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, monitoring, and controlling events arising from risks. The information security program consists of controls, processes, and practices to increase the resilience of the computing environment.

All rights reserved. Lesson 4-1: Troubleshooting Methodologies Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss troubleshooting methodologies. • Explain the bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom OSI troubleshooting models. • Describe how Divide-and-Conquer applies to troubleshooting. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The Troubleshooting Process • Troubleshooting should be a methodical process. • Haphazard guesses are more likely to make a problem worse than better. • When presented with a troubleshooting scenario, use these steps to maximize your chance of resolving the situation in minimal time. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 1. Identify the Problem • Gather information and Question Users • Get as much information as possible from users, from system logs, and from your own observation. • Check the scope of the problem – is it unique to one device, one subnet, one application, or one type of network service? • Duplicate the problem, if possible • Don’t rely on user information alone – users are often mistaken about what exactly is happening, especially with sporadic problems. • Duplicating the problem is the best way to confirm the nature and scope of the problem and to establish a reliable baseline for testing. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 1. Identify the Problem (contd.) • Identify Symptoms • Document symptoms which are clearly related to the problem, for example specific error messages, missing network resources, etc. • Determine if anything has changed • Many (perhaps most) sudden problems occur because something changed. • Was new hardware added, locally or on the network? • Did any software or settings change? • Tracing any changes which occurred when the network problem appeared (recently or before) is often the fastest route to a solution. • Approach multiple problems individually • Multiple symptoms, even when they appear nearly simultaneously, can be confusing or even misleading – focus on one set of symptoms at a time and trace them to their root cause Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause • Question the obvious! • How long has this problem been happening? • What were you doing when the error first happened? • Is your computer on? • Is your network connected? • Can you access other network resources? • Are other users having the same problem? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause (contd.) • Consider multiple troubleshooting approaches to establish a theory of what’s wrong: • Bottom-to-Top OSI Model • Is the physical connection OK? (layer 1) • Do we have a data link? (link indicator) • Do we have an IP address? • Can we browse the Internet or other network resources? • Are any applications working? (HTTP, Mail, ICMP/Ping) • Top-to-Bottom OSI Model 1 - Physical 2 - Data Link 3 - Network 4 - Transport 5 - Session 6 - Presentation 7 -Application Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Troubleshooting Approaches (contd.) • Divide-and-Conquer: How can you split the scope of the problem into two pieces, to determine which piece has the problem? • Test one subnet (disconnect if needed). • Move the faulty device to a different part of the network. • Try connecting to other network resources. • Try alternate software. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 3. Testing Your Theory • Once you have a theory on the cause of the problem, how do you prove it? • Think about what ELSE must happen if your theory is true. • Possible ways to prove your theory: • Replace part • Change setting • Swap computers • Change user accounts/login credentials • Once your theory is confirmed, what is your next step to resolve the problem? • If your theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate the problem Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 4. Implement and Verify • Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects. • Include appropriate vendors, contractors, and stakeholders as necessary. • Request and receive any appropriate approvals. • Implement the solution or escalate as necessary • Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventative measures • Document findings, actions, and outcomes • Inform users and stakeholders of any changes in equipment or recommended operating procedures.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Describe three causes of signal loss. • Explain the problem caused by overlapping channels. • Define signal-to-noise ratio and its relationship to power levels. • Discuss the difference between bandwidth saturation and device saturation. • Explain the difference between thin access points and thick or fat access points, and the use of LWAPP in managing thin access points. • Describe the problems caused by having the wrong encryption type or wrong antenna type. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Troubleshooting Wireless • WLANS often benefit more from troubleshooting and optimization than wired LANs. • WLAN speed can be affected more than wired LANs. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Wireless Basics • Throughput – a measure of the speed data travels on the connection. • Frequency – the radio wavelengths used by a given wireless connection. • Channels – predefined blocks of frequencies • In the 2.4GHz band up to 14 channels are defined (11 usable in the US). • In the 5GHz band the available standard 20MHz channels vary by country, but 23 are available in the US. • Some access points can use “fatter” channels of 40, 80, or 120MHz for more throughput. • Distance – how far the wireless device is from the wireless access point (AP). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Signal Loss • Signal loss is a weak or non-existent wireless signal, and may be caused by: • Distance • Environmental factors, especially concrete/brick walls or metal studs • Interference, especially from other devices in the 2.4GHz band • Consider repositioning your AP for better signal coverage, or adding an additional AP to compensate for environmental barriers. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Interference • Signal interference can significantly decrease overall throughput by forcing APs and clients to retransmit corrupted frames. • In the 2.4GHz band (802.11b, g, ac, and sometimes n) interference can come from other electronics which use this spectrum, including Bluetooth, cordless phones, and microwave ovens. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Channel Issues • Overlapping Channels • In the 2.4GHz band there are 11 usable channels, but each channel overlaps 2-4 adjacent channels. • For an optimal signal without interferences, channels should be chosen which do not overlap other nearby APs. • In 802.11n and 802.11ac, fatter channels can be used to increase bandwidth, but these can be more likely to overlap. • Mismatched channels – with certain settings APs and clients can be forced into using different channels (e.g. 3 and 4). While some signaling may work, mismatched channels are unlikely to be usable. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Signal, Noise, and Bounce • Wireless APs transmit at a certain power level. • Increasing the power (if possible) can increase distance and potentially reduce interference. • The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is a measurement of the intended signal from a wireless device compared with the normal background noise, measured in decibels (db). • 10-15db is the minimum acceptable • 25-40db is good • 41db+ is excellent • Increasing transmit power can improve SNR. • Higher power signals can also bounce off walls and other surfaces, increasing range but also creating multiple signals (multipath propagation/degradation) and may cause clients to connect to a distant AP rather than a nearby one. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Saturation • Device Saturation is when a given AP or device is overwhelmed with too many connections. • Bandwidth Saturation is when too many devices are trying to use the same frequencies, overwhelming the available bandwidth. • Adding more Access Points, at different bands, can solve saturation effects. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Thin vs. Thick • “Thick” or “Fat” wireless access points handle management, security, authentication, and the connection to the wired switch. • “Thin” access points offload most of the management functions to a separate, shared WLAN Controller via LWAPP (Lightweight Access Point Protocol). • “Thin” access points may be less likely to experience device saturation, BUT overworking the WLAN Controller is still possible. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Other Wireless Issues • Rogue Access Point – an AP within range of your wireless clients which uses the same SSID in an attempt to gain access to those devices, possibly for a man-in-the-middle attack. • Open Networks – using an AP with no encryption set at all. Besides leaving your network more vulnerable, open access points make it easy for intruders to spy on packets sent by any device connected to the open AP. • Wrong SSID – often caused when an AP is replaced and the new SSID is manually set and mistyped. • Wrong Encryption – If an AP is set with the wrong encryption, it could mean clients connect at too low a speed or not at all. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Antennas • Different antennas serve different purposes. • Omnidirectional antennas radiate a signal in all directions, but generally along a horizontal plane. • Directional antennas create a “cone” of signal in a specific direction. • When clients are unable to “see” an Access Point, consider whether the antenna on the client or the AP may be incorrectly configured. • MIMO technologies can make use of multiple device antennas to increase throughput. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Untested Updates • Updating Access Points and wireless devices with newer software and firmware generally improves their performance and security. • However, updates are not perfect and may cause unintended consequences. • Testing updates on sample equipment to verify performance before rolling them out to the entire network is a good idea.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Define shorts, opens, and crosstalk as it applies to network cabling. • Discuss EMI/RFI and its effect on copper cabling. • List the maximum recommended distances for each category of Ethernet cabling. • Explain the likely symptoms of split pairs or Tx/Rx reversed wiring. • Describe some possible causes of a bad GBIC or bad SFP. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Basic Copper Problems • Shorts – a condition when two copper wires are touching each other, creating one combined circuit. • Opens – a condition when there is a break or gap in the wiring, preventing any signal from passing through. • Incorrect Termination – mismatched wire pairs Standard End Crossover End Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Crosstalk • Crosstalk is when a signal transmitted on one circuit or wire pair affects the signal transmitted on another circuit or wire pair. • In Ethernet cables crosstalk often occurs due to EMI generated by one wire pair influencing the signal on another wire pair. • Crosstalk can be minimized by: • Using twisted-pair cables (and maintaining the twist ratio) • Using shielded cables • Separating cables. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. EMI and RFI • EMI/RFI – Electromagnetic Interference or radio- frequency interference, signal distortion caused by electromagnetic induction or electromagnetic radiation from an external source. • To mitigate EMI/RFI signal problems: • Use twisted-pair cabling • Use shielded cabling • Be mindful of cable placement - avoid running cable near EMI/RFI point sources such as lighting fixtures, electrical panels, and any radio transmitters. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Distance Limitations • Always remember copper cabling has a limited recommended distance. • Beyond the recommended distance, signal degradation and attenuation (Db loss) can cause packet loss or render the signal unusable. • For category 3, 5, 5e, and 6a cables the maximum recommended distance is 100m. • For category 6 cables the maximum distance is 55m. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Bad Connectors and Wiring • Bad connectors are problematic – they may work most of the time but fail sporadically. • Bad wiring can cause unexpected packet loss and signal degradation. • Testing with a Cable Certifier is a good way to find bad connectors and bad wiring. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Split pairs and Tx/Rx Reverse • What would happen if you swapped wires 1 and 3 on both ends of a EIA/TIA568b wired connector? • It will work, but not correctly. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Split pairs and Tx/Rx Reverse (contd.) • This is known as a Split Pair, where the pins are wired correctly but not in pairs. • Without the EMI/RFI protection of the twisted pairs, signal degradation is very likely. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Split pairs and Tx/Rx Reverse (contd.) • What would happen if the Transmit and Receive wires in a pair are inadvertently swapped? • Depending on the connected device, this may be auto-sensed as a crossover cable and may work correctly. Or it may not work at all. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Bad GBIC/SFP • GBIC (Gigabit Interface Converter) and SFP (Small Factor Pluggable, a smaller type of gigabit Ethernet controller) convert gigabit Ethernet from a switch or router into a high speed connection over fiber optic cables or other connections. • Problems with GBIC or SFP modules may be caused by foreign objects in the GBIC slot, by problems with the cables connected to the GBIC, or by a faulty or incompatible GBIC module.

After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Explain bend radius limitations and their effect on fiber cabling. • List distance limitations of common types of fiber cabling. • Describe wavelength, fiber type, and connector mismatches. • Discuss the possible causes and effects of a bad SFP/GBIC. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Basic Fiber Problems • Bend Radius Limitations – fiber cabling is more fragile than copper and can break or fail if the wire is twisted or bent beyond its stated bend radius limitation. • Dirty connectors – fiber connections must transmit light without undue refraction or distortion, and so are more susceptible to dirty connectors on cables or switch/router ports. • Distance limitations – although generally much longer than copper, fiber cabling will suffer from signal attenuation (Db loss) if used beyond its recommended maximum distance: • 100baseFX: 2km • 10GbaseSR: 400m • 10GbaseER: 40km • 10GbaseSW: 300m Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Fiber Mismatches • A Fiber type mismatch occurs when two different types of fiber cabling are used on the same segment (e.g. Splicing single-mode and multimode or multimode with different sized cores). • As much as 99% of the signal can be lost in a fiber type mismatch! • A wavelength mismatch most often occurs with single strand fiber cabling, which can accommodate transmitting and receiving at the same time on different wavelengths. To work properly one end must terminate in a 1310/1550 media converter and the other end with a 1550/1310 media converter. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Fiber Mismatches (contd.) • A connector mismatch occurs when trying to connect a fiber cable of one type to switch ports of another type. • Purchasing cables to match your equipment (and installation tools) is critical with fiber!

Here is a quick recap of what we have learned in this lesson. Summary • Fiber cabling is more fragile than copper and can break or fail if the wire is twisted or bent beyond its stated bend radius. • A Fiber type mismatch occurs when two different types of fiber cabling are used on the same segment (e.g. Splicing single-mode and multimode or multimode with different sized cores). • A connector mismatch occurs when trying to connect a fiber cable of one type to switch ports or GBIC ports of another type. • Purchasing cables to match your equipment (and installation tools) is critical with fiber.

All rights reserved. Lesson 4-6: Troubleshooting Common Network Issues Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss the likely symptoms of incorrect IP configuration. • Describe the probable effects of misconfigured DHCP or DNS. • Explain the problem of broadcast storms. • Discuss interface errors such as mismatched duplex or speed. • Describe a situation which can cause a problem with end-to-end connectivity. • List network discovery protocols. • Explain what is meant by NIC teaming misconfiguration. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Basic IP Problems • Incorrect IP Configuration – if the IP address, Gateway, subnet mask, or DNS server configuration for a host is incorrect, they may find it impossible to communicate. This is easily checked via the network interface or ipconfig. • Link-Local – if the IP address is a link-local or APIPA address (e.g. 169.254.0.1 or similar), the device is not connected to a DHCP server or the server’s scope is exhausted. • Duplicate IP – two devices on the same subnet with the same IP may happen when one or both uses a static IP or when a DHCP server is reset. One or both devices will be unable to communicate until the situation is resolved. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Misconfigured DHCP • Your DHCP server provides IP configuration settings to DHCP- enabled clients on the network. Common DHCP problems include: • DHCP misconfiguration – where the DHCP server is programmed to give out unusable subnet, DHCP, or gateway information. • Rogue DHCP – when a second DHCP server begins handling some DHCP requests on the network, often due to a rogue router. • Scope exhaustion – when the DHCP server has exhausted the available IP addresses in its designated scope. DHCP DHCP Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Misconfigured DNS • DNS issues can easily be tested with PING – if a device can PING to an IP address but cannot PING to a hostname, it indicates the IP network is OK but DNS name resolution is not working. Possible causes: • Manually set DNS server is incorrect. • DHCP-supplied DNS server is incorrect. • DNS server is not resolving properly. • Manually setting DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google’s free public DNS servers) can be a good test. • Symptoms of misconfigured DNS: Unable to browse some or all websites, applications perform erratically when trying to access named servers or other resources. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Broadcast Storms vs. Jabber • A broadcast storm is an overwhelming number of useless packets being sent through network infrastructure. • Can be caused by a switching loop (multiple routes between two or more switches, not port aggregation via LACP). • Network traffic will be extremely slow or unreliable until the storm is resolved. • Jabber is a network disturbance caused by a faulty NIC or switch/router port. • Jabber is usually an electrical disturbance, not legitimate network traffic, and is usually stopped at a switch port. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Simultaneous Wired/Wireless Connections • It’s not uncommon for laptop (and some other) users to have both wired and wireless connections to the network. • This does not improve the speed of their connection since only one interface will be used for any particular session. • If the interfaces are configured (statically or dynamically) for different gateways or DNS servers, the user may experience random, sporadic differences in connections or even outages if one is configured improperly. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Interface Errors: Speed, Duplex, and VLAN Misconfiguration • Connections to a switch or router are generally set to auto- sense the speed and duplex of the connecting device by default. • Manually configuring speed, duplex, and other interface settings can improve speed when auto-sense is incorrect, but may also lead to interface incompatibilities now or in the future. • Remember switch ports may be assigned to specific VLANs as well, so connecting devices intended for a different VLAN will cause connection problems or interface errors. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. End-to-End Connectivity • Connections may involve numerous intermediary devices – switches, bridges, routers, etc. • To maintain a given throughput ALL components must meet the minimum criteria. • Example: NIC – Category 5e cable – switch – Category 3 cable – switch – Category 5e cable – router • The Cat3 cable will limit the end-to-end throughput to 10Mbps • MTU black hole – when an intermediate router’s MTU (maximum transmit unit) is too small to accommodate packets sent by a previous router. • Firewall black hole – when a firewall is dropping packets intended for a specific address or network. • Missing IP routes – when a routing path attempts to use routes which do not exist. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Discovery Issues • If you find you can ping or access network devices using their IP address, but cannot see or access them by their network name, a network discovery protocol is the most likely culprit. • Network discovery and naming protocols include: • NetBIOS – used by default on Windows computers, also available on other devices, uses a local cache or hosts file or a special broadcast to resolve names. • WINS – Windows Internet Name Service, a server-based database of local machine names • DNS – Domain Name Services, the protocol which resolves domain names on the Internet (and can be used internally as well) • Bonjour – protocol primarily used by Apple computers Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. NIC Teaming Misconfiguration • NIC Teaming is a function to combine two or more Network Interfaces for the purposes of load- balancing or failover. • NIC Teams can be created as: • Active-active: Both NICs are active and being used • Active-passive: One NIC is active, the other is on standby in case the first NIC fails. • The NIC Team is either configured with a multicast address (packets are sent to all involved NICs – if they are joined to the multicast address) or a broadcast address (all NICs, including those not in the team, receive the packet). • NIC Teaming misconfiguration occurs when one or more NICs are not connected to the same network, or are not joined to the multicast address. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Physical Issues • Cable Placement – running copper cables near EMI/RFI sources can degrade performance or cause sporadic communication issues. • Power failure/anomalies – power outages obviously affect all IT equipment, but special concerns with networks include: • Power sequencing issues – problems caused when certain network components’ power on are out of order (e.g. endpoints before DHCP server). • Power anomalies – if power levels fluctuate, it can cause network transmissions to become garbled or unstable. • Hardware failure – of course, hardware failure is a standard part of any IT project, including networks. Replacement components should be maintained to prevent a single point of failure. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Quiz Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved.

All rights reserved. Lesson 4-7: Troubleshooting Common Security Issues Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Discuss the security vulnerabilities related to misconfigured firewalls, ACLs, and applications. • Define a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. • Describe the Ping of Death attack. • Explain the risk associated with default passwords and backdoor access. • Identify the difference between trusted and untrusted users. • Define jamming as it relates to wireless networks. • Discuss the security implications of firmware and OS patches. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Security Problems 101 • Security issues fall into three categories: • Someone has access where they shouldn’t. • Someone doesn’t have access where they should. • Defending the network from malicious attacks. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Malicious Users • Malicious users seek to damage the network or to improperly use the organization’s resources for personal gain. • Untrusted users are those outside the organization with no valid access to any private part of the network. • Trusted users are generally those inside the organization or who have valid credentials to access some portion of the network. • Trusted malicious users are a great risk since they have more opportunities to gain access to the network, such as planting backdoor accounts or connecting a packet sniffer to an unprotected switch. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Firewall Configuration Issues • Firewall misconfiguration manifests in one of the two ways: • Traffic is allowed that should be blocked. • Traffic is blocked that should be allowed (maybe all). • Firewall rules explicitly allow or deny traffic from specific IP addresses and/or ports, and packet content in some cases, so reviewing the rules should show the problem. • Remember that rules are processed in order – lower rules may not apply if a higher rule’s criteria is met. • Remember the “Implicit Deny” rule – adding an explicit deny may help with logging and troubleshooting. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Other Configuration Issues • ACL misconfiguration: similar to a Firewall, the ACL allows or denies traffic based on a set of rules. • ACL rules are usually stateless – they can only be based on IP address or port. • Just like a firewall ACL rules generally include an implicit deny. • Application misconfiguration occurs when an application – especially applications which must be exposed through the firewall – do not have proper restrictions in place and could allow users access to other secure resources. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Edge Issues The edge or border is where your LAN interacts with the WAN. Edge issues can include: • Denial of Service (DoS or DDoS) – an intentional or unintentional disruption of service due to overwhelming traffic to a server or network device. • DDoS attacks can be mitigated with the use of a proxy server and/or help from your WAN vendor. • Ping of Death – a special type of DoS attack using a malformed ping packet which, when reassembled can cause buffer overflows or system crashes on the receiving server. Ping of Death is routinely filtered out by firewalls and ISPs today. • Open/Closed ports – open ports allow packets to flow to or from a device, while closed ports drop traffic to the device. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Edge Issues (contd.) • Unreachable default gateway – if your default gateway (router) is unreachable, traffic can’t flow to or from the WAN. • An ICMP command, route redirect, can be used to redirect traffic from a default gateway to an alternate gateway (presumably under the attacker’s control) to be used as a “man-in-the-middle” style attack. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Authentication Issues (TACACS/RADIUS Misconfiguration) • TACACS+ and RADIUS are forms of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers that verify users before allowing them access to certain network resources (APs, VPNs, switches, etc.) • AAA solutions involve three elements – a client (requesting access), a supplicant (the device the client is connecting to), and the server. • AAA misconfiguration can occur when: • Client and server are using different ports • Client and server are not using the correct pre-shared key (PSK) • Supplicant is configured for the wrong RADIUS or TACACS+ server group • User isn’t configured on the AAA server • Some AAA servers also include a default user and password – make sure this is changed so it’s not available to an unauthorized user. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Backdoor Access • Many devices (routers, servers, switches) are configured with default administrator accounts. • These accounts should be disabled or changed to prevent unauthorized use. • In some cases temporary users with access to administrative credentials may plant their own username and password onto a system for their own future unauthorized use (backdoor access). Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. ARP Cache Poisoning • ARP – Address Resolution Protocol, used to translate IP addresses into MAC addresses. • ARP Cache – a table each device builds and maintains which matches IP addresses to MAC addresses based on ARP packets received (not just ARP packets requested). • ARP Cache Poisoning is a technique by which a local machine sends ARP packets to redirect IP packets intended for another device to itself or to another host. • Only works on the local segment • Also called ARP Spoofing or ARP Poison Routing Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Banner Grabbing/OUI • Banners are messages generated by a router, firewall, or other network device in response to an error. • Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) are the first 24 bits of a MAC address and identify the manufacturer of the device. • By using protocols such as telnet or SSH attackers can try to reach key network components. Even if unsuccessful, the information gleaned from the banner or from the OUI can provide the hacker with important information regarding the type of device so they can research and exploit any known weaknesses. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Domain/Local Group Configuration • On an Active Directory network, Domain Local groups are a type of user group which can assign access to users who are outside of the local domain. • Improperly configuring a domain local group or assigning a trusted user to a domain local group may give them access to network resources beyond what was intended. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Jamming • Jamming is a wireless technique to block access to certain frequencies by flooding the airwaves with a powerful signal. • It can be used in an “evil twin” style attack where the attacker sets up their own AP on a different channel than the organization’s APs, then jams the frequencies of the real APs. • Wireless clients will not be able to “see” the real APs and thus will connect to the rogue AP instead. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Patches and Malware • Firmware and Operating System patches are often used to close vulnerabilities that could allow an intruder access to your equipment. • Malware protection is important for any PC or Server, and malware definitions are often updated daily to include recently discovered strains of known malware and viruses. • Keeping your patches and malware definitions up to date helps to prevent intruders from exploiting your systems.

All rights reserved. Lesson 4-8: Troubleshooting Common WAN Issues Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Define Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) and demarc. • Discuss how DNS issues, interference, and the split horizon issue can affect WAN connectivity. • Describe WAN issues specific to satellite connections. • Explain how company security policy can emulate a WAN issue. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Troubleshooting Responsibility • WAN providers typically guarantee service up to a point known as the demarc. • Troubleshooting from the demarc to and through the internal LAN is the client’s responsibility. • Troubleshooting outside the demarc is the WAN provider’s responsibility. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) Demarc Smart Jack / NIU CSU/DSU CPE • CPE is the equipment owned by and maintained by the organization (also called DTE, data terminal equipment). • The WAN provider can run a loopback test up to the Smart Jack/NIU. • In some cases copper line drivers/repeaters are used to extend the demarc connection to another floor or building – in those cases the drivers/repeaters become another element in any troubleshooting. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Loss of Internet Connectivity • The most common WAN issue is probably loss of Internet connectivity. In those cases: • Check the WAN interface for errors. Link status may be accessible from the CSU/DSU panel. • DNS issues manifest when LAN devices can access external IP addresses but not external domain names. If the WAN providers’ DNS servers are not responding correctly, alternate DNS servers can be used for testing. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Loss of Internet Connectivity (contd.) • Misconfiguration between the CPE router and the CSU/DSU can also cause connectivity issues. • Verify speed and duplex. • Check the router WAN configuration settings and error log. • Interference can be an issue with wireless WAN connections. • Repositioning antennas or switching channels (where possible) may solve the issue. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Satellite Issues • Satellite WAN connections can involve additional troubleshooting steps. • Satellite links can be slow or non-existent during severe weather conditions such as storms or high wind. • Debris such as snow or leaves on the satellite dish can impede or block reception. • Satellite dishes need a clear line-of-sight to a compatible satellite. • Even when working properly, satellite WANs have much higher latency than other WAN types. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Fair Access Policy • Some WAN providers (especially satellite-based providers) implement a “Fair Access Policy” which limits or throttles bandwidth after an account has reached a preset download threshold. • Depending on the provider, the limit may be in place for 24 hours or until the next billing cycle. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Frame Relay - Split Horizon • Split Horizon is a technique to prevent routing loops. • Frame Relay WAN connections disable split horizon by default. • This is normal, but can cause problems for some protocols and tests. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Company Security Policy • In some cases a company’s security policy (implemented at a firewall or router) can mimic WAN issues. • For example, the policy may block access from certain applications or to certain sites. • The policy could also choose to throttle (limit) bandwidth on certain applications or ports, or to certain sites, rather than an outright block.

Lesson 5-1: Policies and Procedures Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: ● Describe the role of Policies and Procedures in an organization ● Identify the different types of Security Policies ● Describe the use of ‘Consent to Monitoring’ clauses ● Explain Acceptable Use Policies of an organization ● Describe common standard business documents, including a Service Level Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding, Master Services Agreement, and Statement of Work Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Every organization needs Policies and Procedures for their users. • Policies communicate to users what behavior is expected and what behavior is not allowed, and create a legal foundation to take action against those users if the Policies are not followed. • Procedures define what steps will be taken in the event of a security breach or other serious issues. • NOT having well-defined Policies and Procedures leave users and administrators to decide for themselves what behavior is appropriate and what should be done to resolve issues, and the results are likely to be unpredictable. Policies and Procedures Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Security Policies Security Policies may include guidelines for: • Physical Security – access to the building, access to servers, and access to key network components. • Data and Document Security – this pertains to where important information is stored (both digitally and physically) and how data stored on mobiles, laptops, flash drives, printouts, and other media should be handled. • Network Security (Network Policies) – this pertains to defining levels of user access for sensitive areas of the network, password retention policies. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Consent to Monitoring A common part of Security Policies is a ‘Consent to Monitoring’ clause, which notifies the user that their activities on the organization’s computer, network, or website may be monitored. Consent to Monitoring clauses are also commonly included in online Terms and Conditions on websites and web applications. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Acceptable Use Policies An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is a set of rules governing how an organization’s network, website, and other computer systems should be used. • New employees or members are generally required to sign an Acceptable Use Policy as a condition of using the organization’s systems. • Failure to abide by the AUP can result in disciplinary actions and/or the termination of employment with a company. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Standard Business Documents – Service Level Agreement A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement defining the scope, quality, and responsibilities related to a service. • In the IT sector, an SLA is commonly used in a vendor/client relationship to detail the responsibilities of the vendor in providing a specific service. For example, the SLA for an Internet service provider might guarantee 99% uptime and a 2 hour outage response. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Standard Business Documents– Memorandum of Understanding A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) documents the agreed upon terms between two parties. • Less binding than a formal agreement or contract, an MOU is often the first step in documenting the relationship between two parties. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. A Master Services Agreement (MSA) is a contract between two parties that specifies the terms of the relationship between the parties. • The MSA often details general areas such as payment terms, warranties, ownership of intellectual property, dispute resolution, and similar general items. • In IT relationships, an MSA is often used to establish the framework for transactions while each project is detailed in a specific Statement of Work. Standard Business Documents– Master Services Agreement Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. A Statement of Work (SOW) details the specific requirements and deliverables for a particular project. • The SOW generally includes pricing, delivery timetables, deliverables and/or activities, as well as general terms and conditions and criteria for acceptable quality standards.

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) is the sudden transfer of static electricity into a computer, server, or similar device, and it is a serious danger to computer and network equipment. • Static energy (Electrostatic charges) can build up in people, in tools, or in other equipment. If a charged person or item comes into contact with a conductive piece of equipment – such as a computer – the static energy can discharge into the equipment, causing significant damage. • To prevent the risk of ESD, grounding straps can be employed to connect a person or tool to a Ground source, discharging any potential static electricity before it can come into contact with sensitive equipment. • Grounding mats help prevent the buildup of static electricity as well. • Whenever possible unplug equipment before servicing it. Electrostatic Discharge Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Installation Safety Physical injury from lifting equipment is not uncommon among IT professionals. • To protect yourself from injury, remember these techniques: • Lift with your legs, not your back • Bend at your knees, NOT at your waist • Do not twist when lifting • Keep heavy objects close to your torso • Push instead of pull whenever possible Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Rack Installation Network racks provide a cleaner, safer way to mount network devices compared to scattered devices on shelves, walls, and floors. Some considerations when using racks: • If using a rack, make sure equipment is mounted properly with appropriate electrical power and ventilation. • Make sure the rack is balanced and secured – too much equipment near the top of the rack can make it top-heavy and more likely to fall over. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. When working inside servers or other computer equipment, be mindful of using conductive or magnetic tools that may short out powered circuits or potentially cause data problems with hard drives or other media. • Protect your eyes, nose, and mouth when using compressed air to clean inside equipment – always blow away from your body. • Avoid using any equipment which can generate static electricity – especially standard vacuum cleaners. If necessary, special static-free vacuum cleaners, sometimes called data vacs or toner vacs, are available. Tool Safety Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Equipment placed on the floor is more likely to collect dust through ventilation fans, and more likely to be damaged by flooding. • Equipment placed up high is more likely to fall or cause a shelf or rack to tip over. • Servers and other network equipment should never be placed near a potential water source – this includes break rooms or kitchens where there is any risk of a user spilling a drink on or in the equipment. • All equipment should have adequate cooling and air flow – be especially mindful of cables which can block access or block air vents for other equipment. Placement Considerations Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Materials Safety Data Sheet A Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) accompanies any chemicals or other dangerous items. In IT, this will generally include cleaning supplies but may also include toner or ink used in printing. • The MSDS details physical characteristics of the substance including its melting point, boiling point, flash point, toxicity, health effects, reactivity, storage concerns, and disposal information. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Emergency Procedures IT personnel should consider the effect of emergency procedures on the IT systems. This includes: • Building Layout – Are rooms and furniture arranged so that people can’t be trapped in case of a fire or other disaster? • Fire Escape Plan – Are there clearly designated routes out of the building in case of fire? Is there a designated meeting point to verify staff safety? • Safety/Emergency Exits – Are the emergency exits well marked and easily accessible, especially if power fails? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Emergency Procedures (contd.) • Fail Open/Fail Close – If electrical power fails, should doors with electronic locks automatically open (“fail open”) or stay locked (“fail closed”)? If they Fail Close, is there a manual override to prevent people from being trapped behind the door? • Emergency Alert Systems – Is there a system in place to alert everyone when a fire or other disaster occurs? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Emergency Procedures • Fire Suppression Systems – Are fire extinguishers readily available in case of fire? Should a water-based fire sprinkler system be in place, or is a more expensive Halon system a better choice? (Water-based sprinklers are most common but will damage computer equipment if deployed. Halon is a non- conducting fire suppressant, which is less likely to destroy IT systems) • HVAC – Is the environmental system adequate to prevent overheating in server rooms and other IT areas? Are humidity controls in place to prevent high humidity (which can cause corrosion) or very low humidity (which can cause static electricity problems)? Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. QUIZ a. b. c. d.

All rights reserved. When planning the installation of equipment, particularly at a new location, consideration has to be given to the following: • Electrical Systems – will there be sufficient electrical power and connections to supply the immediate equipment needs as well as reasonably estimated future expansion? Can better backup and surge protection needs also be accommodated? • Data Cabling – how will data cabling be run so that all connectivity needs are met and the cabling is properly terminated, organized, and labeled to make future troubleshooting easier? • Mounting and Placement – what equipment will be needed to properly and securely mount and access the cables, servers, and other devices? • Environmental Controls – when all equipment and cabling is in place, will there be sufficient air flow and cooling to ensure the equipment operates properly? Installation Considerations Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Distribution Frame A Distribution Frame is a device which terminates cables, allowing interconnections. • The Main Distribution Frame (MDF) serves to connect equipment outside the facility (incoming phone or Internet connections from an outside provider) with equipment inside the facility. • The MDF is generally the demarcation point between the LAN (internal) and the WAN (external). • Larger sites or campuses may also have Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDF), which connect cables running from the MDF with cabling to local devices in a particular building, department, or area. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Cable Management While many devices do connect wirelessly, wired connections are still the backbone of a modern network. Rather than have dozens of cables connecting directly from the data outlet to the switch at the Distribution Frame, a well-organized network will make use of Patch Panels. • Patch Panels are termination points for cabling from data outlets. Each cable terminates into a punch-down block on the back of the patch panel, connecting with a labeled port on the front. • Short Ethernet or Fiber Optic cables called Patch Cables (usually < 3ft or 1m long) are used to connect the Patch Panel and nearby switches or other devices. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Cable Trays A Cable Tray is a tube, ladder, or channel which serves as a conduit for data cables. Cable trays keep cables organized and protected. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Clean, constant power is essential for any computer system. Electrical spikes, dips, and outages can damage sensitive components. Devices that aid in power management include: • Power converters –these convert power from AC to DC, convert one voltage to another, or convert one frequency to another. • Circuits – A circuit carries power from the circuit breaker to power outlets, lights, and direct-wired devices. Placing too many devices on one circuit can lead to tripped circuit breakers or dangerous overload situations. Power Management Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Power Management • UPS - Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) are batteries that supply power when the line voltage fails. Some can also provide supplemental power if line voltage drops, which is a feature called brownout protection. • Inverters – Inverters convert DC current to AC current and are often used in vehicles to allow the use of AC current devices from the vehicle’s DC current electrical system. • Power redundancy – When downtime becomes a significant problem, a redundant power supply can prevent outages due to a failed power supply. Each power supply can also be tied to a different Circuit, called A+B Power or A/B Power, to prevent outages due to a circuit failure. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Air Flow • Most computers and many network devices use cooling fans to expel hot air and bring in cool air to keep their components running optimally. • If the ambient air temperature is too high, or if the ventilation ports are blocked by debris, furniture, or cables, the equipment can overheat. • Overheating can result in crashes, reboots, unexpected errors, and a shorter life span for digital equipment. • To prevent problems, adequate room for air flow should be provided around each device, including sufficient air conditioning. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Rack Systems Rack Systems hold servers, switches, and other devices in a standardized vertical arrangement. • Standard Racks are 19” wide and are measured vertically in units called Rack Units or U. One U is 1.75” tall, and rack- mounted devices are specified in U (for example, a 48-port rack-mount patch panel is often 2U, or 3.5” tall). • Freestanding Racks stand on their own without being secured to a ceiling or wall. • Server Rail Racks mount a server onto a data rack and allow it to slide out for maintenance. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Types of Data Racks 2-post Rack 4-post Rack Wall-Mount Rack Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Rack Monitoring and Security • Data Racks can be secured with a front door to prevent physical access. • Data Racks can also be outfitted with monitoring devices which can remotely report on the condition of the rack. • Attributes monitored can include: • Temperature • Humidity/Water • Smoke detection • Door Open Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Labeling Troubleshooting problems in the network can be a stressful task when systems are down and management is upset. The key to easier troubleshooting is organization and labeling. • Port and Patch Panel labeling – ports on routers and firewalls should be labeled, as well as the outlets or patch panels to which they connect • System labeling - labeling computer systems, especially workstations, can make it easier to keep a log of issues and track issue patterns. • Circuit labeling – when multiple power circuits are used, labeling power outlets with their corresponding circuit is critical. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Naming Conventions Before creating labels, choosing a consistent naming convention is important. • Some naming systems use words, others use numbers, some use bar codes – the format is less important than being consistent throughout the organization.

Lesson 5-4: Change Management Procedures Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Describe a Change Request • Identify the components of a Change Request • Discuss the Approval Process • Explain the difference between Maintenance Windows and Downtime Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Network Changes Any significant alteration of a network that impacts how the network is used. Examples of Network Changes: • Physically moving network equipment to a new location • Configuration changes to IP addresses or subnets • Replacement of network routers, switches, or other equipment • Changes to policies or procedures • Changes to shared drives or devices Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Change Requests Changes to network configurations should not be done casually. Any change needs to be planned, documented, approved, and tested. The procedure for requesting, approving, testing, communicating, and documenting a network change is referred to as a Change Request. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The process must begin with documenting the reason for the requested change. • During the process, if the requested change is adjusted due to conflicts or other reasons, the final change must still address the original reason – or else, there is no reason to change. Document Reason for the Change Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The initial stage of making the change starts with a change request. Depending on the nature and size of the organization this may be formal or informal. The Change Request should include: • Configuration procedures – what exact steps are needed to implement the change? • Rollback process – in case of problems, how will the change be rolled back? • Potential impact – what possible risks are caused by this change? What other systems are affected? • Notification – who needs to be notified of the change, and how will they be notified? Department heads, users, and other system administrators are likely to be included here. Change Request Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Approval Process Change requests should be reviewed by an appropriate cross- section of affected parties – users, department heads, and IT staff. Some organizations have formal approval processes for significant network changes, which may include a Change Control Board to take responsibility for supervising the change. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Maintenance Windows and Downtime Many networks have designated Maintenance Windows, often on weekends when network usage is low. • Significant changes should be done during the Maintenance Window. • When changes cannot be performed during designated Maintenance Windows, additional Authorized Downtime can be scheduled with the permission of management. • While Downtime can refer to any time when the network or systems are unavailable due to issues or maintenance, planned downtime such as Maintenance Windows and other Authorized Downtime is less disruptive than unscheduled outages. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Once the change is complete, and any issues are resolved, all users and stakeholders affected by the change must be notified that the change is complete. Notification can include: • Users • System Administrators • Helpdesk and technical support teams • Training staff • Any other stakeholders Notification of Change Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. The final step is to update the network documentation to include: • Any changes to the network configurations • Any additions to the network • Any physical location changes • Any other significant network changes Documentation Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.

This chapter focused on the day-to-day, moment-by-moment, use of security controls and risk mitigation strategies in an organization. We discovered ways to secure data and the systems they reside on. Data (information) security as a process and discipline provides a structure for protecting the value of data as the organization creates, stores, shares, uses, modifies, archives and finally destroys that data (known as data handling). During data handling, an organization classifies (assigns data sensitivity levels), categorizes (determines type of data), labels (applies a name to the data), retains (determines how long to keep the data) and destroys (erases or destroys) the data. A best practice for securing data is encrypting the data. We explored the process of encrypting data in plaintext with a key and algorithm to create ciphertext then using either the same key (symmetric) or a different key (asymmetric) and same algorithm to decrypt the ciphertext to convert it back to plaintext. Then hashing was methodically described; hashing takes an input set of data (of almost arbitrary size) and returns a fixed-length result called the hash value. System hardening is the process of applying secure configurations (to reduce the attack surface) and locking down various hardware, communications systems and software, including operating system, web server, application server, application, etc. We also discussed configuration management, a process and discipline used to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated. Configuration management consists of identification, baseline, change control, and verification and audit. During configuration management, one must conduct inventory, baselines, updates, and patches. The following best practice security policies were examined: data handling (appropriate use of data), password (appropriate use of passwords), acceptable use (appropriate use of the assets, devices, and data), bring your own device (appropriate use of personal devices), privacy (appropriate protection of one’s privacy), and change management (appropriate transition from current state to a future state). Change management practices address a common set of core activities: documentation, approval, and rollback. It starts with a request for change (RFC) and moves through various development and test stages until the change is released to the end users. We ended the chapter by discussing the importance of security awareness training and how it reduces the internal threat to an organization. By breaking down the levels of security awareness training into education, training, and awareness, we identified that the training can be tailored to the security topic(s), organization, position and/or individual. The module highlighted some of the main threats, including phishing and social engineering and why it's important to include them in your security awareness training programs. We also emphasized the importance of password protection.
