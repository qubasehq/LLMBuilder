Incident Management The process of developing and maintaining the capability to manage incidents within an organization. Incident Response It is the capability to effectively prepare for and respond to unanticipated events to control and limit damage and maintain or restore normal operation. Incident vs Incident Response Incident Unplanned interruption to an IT service ITIL 2011 Incident Management This process ensures that: ●Normal service operation is restored ●Business impact is minimized Incident Response Plan 300 billion passwords exist worldwide in 2020 Service Outage These types of plans address issues like: Data Loss Cybersecurity It is a set of instructions to help IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents. Incident Response Plan Incident Response Plan Defines policies, roles, responsibilities, and actions Is the operational component of an incident management process Details actions, personnel, and activities Requires support from the senior management Incident Management Stages Detect Respond Mitigate Report Recover Remediate Learn Identification of incidents Occurs at various levels Determination of the root cause Who, How, When, Why Prevent occurrence of similar incidents Gathering evidence Adjustments to response strategies Incident Response Metrics Number of incidents Dwell time Time to contain the incidents Time to resolve the incidents Not meeting SLAs Number of people affected Total cost required to resolve the incident Incident Management Team (IMT) Team training prepares a group of individuals to function together as an Incident Management Team or IMT. Incident Management Team Incident Management Team (IMT) Training programs for the IMT On-the-job training Induction to IMT Mentoring teams Formal training Gap Analysis Assesses the differences in performance between a business information system and software applications Desired state Current state Gap analysis provides information on the actions required. Gap Analysis Desired State Current State Compare the two levels to identify: Processes that needs to be improved Resources needed to achieve the objectives Digital Forensics Digital Forensics Digital forensics is the process of revealing and interpreting electronic data, which recovers and investigates the information found in digital devices. Goal of Digital Forensics Examine digital media to identify, analyze, preserve, recover, and present facts and opinions about digital information. Forensics Investigation Process Identification Preservation Collection Examination Analysis Presentation Decision Goal: Preserve any evidence in its most original form while performing a structured investigation. Forensic Process Best Practices Ensure the destination is sanitized before collecting the images Timestamp evidence to show when it was collected Ask investigator to work only on the secondary image Store the primary image in a library Capture deleted files, slack spaces, and unallocated clusters through original image Forensics Investigative Assessment Types Path tracing Log analysis Traffic analysis Network analysis Media analysis Software analysis Hardware/Embedded device review Forensics Investigative Assessment Types Network analysis Media analysis Software analysis Hardware/Embedded device review Disk imaging Timeline analysis Registry analysis Volume shadow analysis Forensics Investigative Assessment Types Network analysis Media analysis Software analysis Hardware/Embedded device review Reverse engineering Malicious code review Exploit review Forensics Investigative Assessment Types Network analysis Media analysis Software analysis Hardware/Embedded device review Dedicated appliance attack points Firmware Dedicated memory inspections Digital Evidence It is defined as information and data value to an investigation that is stored, received, or transmitted by an electronic device. Digital Evidence Stored and transmitted in a binary form Is associated with electronic crime Commonly found in digital devices Used to prosecute crimes The evidence should be: Digital Evidence: Admissible in Court Sufficient Relevant Complete Reliable Evidence Life Cycle Collection and identification Storage, preservation, and transportation Presentation in court Return of evidence to owner Chain of Custody It is a chronological documentation developed from the information gathered at the crime scene. Chain of Custody It should follow the evidence through its entire life cycle The evidence must be labeled with information of who secured and validated it It is a history that shows how the evidence was collected, analyzed, transported, and preserved The copies created should be independently verified and tamperproof Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery Is having a plan to deal with major disruptions Is an organization’s ability to recover from a disaster Business continuity planning Disaster recovery Seven Phases of a Business Continuity Plan 7 Phases The seven phases of business of a business continuity plan is a complex arrangement of critical processes that allows continuation of business activities after an emergency. Seven Phases of a Business Continuity Plan Update and maintain the plan periodically Train personnel Test recovery and continuity plans and procedures Develop recovery and continuity strategies and plans Establish recovery targets Conduct a business impact analysis Develop a business continuity plan policy Business Impact Analysis It is a systematic process to determine and evaluate the potential effects of an interruption to critical business operations. Disaster Recovery Sites Structure and culture Key business processes Acceptable risk Risk tolerance Critical IT and physical resources Business impact analysis Disaster Recovery Sites It is a facility that an organization uses to recover and restore its technology infrastructure and operations. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Recovery Time Objective (RTO) Recovery Time Objective It is the maximum desired length of time allowed between an unexpected failure and the resumption of normal operations. Recovery Point Objective It is the maximum data loss from the onset of a disaster. Maximum Tolerable Downtime This is when the process is unavailable and creates irreversible consequences. Types of Disaster Recovery Sites Hot site Warm site Cold site Disaster Recovery Testing It examines each step in the Disaster Recovery Plan. Types of Disaster Recovery Testing Document review Walk-through test Simulation test Parallel test Cutover test Cloud, Virtualization, BYOD, and IOT Security Virtualization It is a technology that enables multiple operating systems to run side-by-side on same processing hardware. Flexibility Cost Scalability Reliability Performance Virtualization It adds a software layer between an operating system and underlying computer hardware. Virtualization • Efficient • Higher availability and lower cost • Single point of failure • Weaker in security and privacy Pros Cons Hypervisor It is a process that separates computer operating systems and applications from the physical hardware. Hypervisor It uses host machines to help maximize the effective use of computing resources. Memory Network bandwidth CPU cycles Hypervisor It is an instance of a desktop operating system that runs on a centralized server. It refers to a virtual machine that is installed, executed, and hosted on the local physical machine. Host-based virtual machine Guest virtual machine Blue Pill Case Study: Hypervisor Attack This is the software code which can be installed as a thin hypervisor to control the machine under it and intercept the communication between the guest machine and the host machine. Cloud Computing It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and process data. Cloud Computing Characteristics Cloud Computing Features Resource pooling Rapid elasticity Broad network access Measured services On-demand access Categorization of Cloud: Service Categories Software as a Service or SaaS Platform as a service or PaaS Cloud computing can be broken down into three main services: Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS Categorization of Cloud: Deployment Categories Public cloud Private cloud Hybrid cloud Community cloud Computing infrastructure that offers cloud service Categorization of Cloud: Deployment Categories A cloud infrastructure in an organization Public cloud Private cloud Hybrid cloud Community cloud Categorization of Cloud: Deployment Categories Derived from both public and private clouds Public cloud Private cloud Hybrid cloud Community cloud Categorization of Cloud: Deployment Categories An infrastructure between organizations to share data Public cloud Private cloud Hybrid cloud Community cloud Government Country On premises Off premises Cloud Security Challenges Multitenancy Virtualization complexity Multiple jurisdiction Privacy Bring Your Own Device It refers to the policy of permitting employees to bring personal devices. BYOT Bring your own technology BYOP Bring your own phone BYOPC Bring your own personal computer Bring Your Own Device: Security It is a security software used by an IT department to monitor, manage, and secure employees' mobile devices. Mobile Device Management Bring Your Own Device: Security It is similar to mobile device management. However, it manages the entire network of devices. Enterprise Mobility Management IoT (Internet of Things) Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of devices that connect, interact, and exchange data. IoT Security Challenges Insufficient testing and updating Brute-forcing IoT malware and ransomware Data security and privacy concerns Key Takeaways Incident management is a process of developing and maintaining the capability of managing incidents within an organization. Digital forensics examines digital media with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing, and presenting facts and opinions about digital information. Business continuity deals with major disruptions, whereas disaster recovery is an organization’s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected events and resume operations.
