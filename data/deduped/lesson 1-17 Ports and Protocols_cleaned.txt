Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Lesson 1-17: Ports and Protocols Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. After completing this lesson, you will be able to: • Describe a TCP/IP port. • Define protocol as it relates to networking. • Discuss the default port for protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SNMP, and SIP and their appropriate uses. Objectives Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Ports • “Ports” can be visualized as separate connections on a router, but in reality the “Port” designator is specified in the TCP or UDP packet header. • Ports can identify specific services or, through PAT specific devices. • Port is a 16-bit number, representing a potential 65536 possible ports. • Approximately 1024 standard ports are designated, with the others generally considered available for any use. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Protocols • A Protocol is a standard for communication, with rules and conventions to facilitate communication between two devices. • Protocols exist at different layers of the OSI model – IP is a layer 3 protocol, TCP is a layer 4 protocol, HTTP is a layer 7 protocol. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. TCP and UDP • TCP, Transmission Control Protocol, is a connection-oriented protocol and part of the TCP/IP Suite. • UDP, User Datagram Protocol, is a connectionless protocol and part of the TCP/IP Suite. • The rest of the protocols we’ll look at are built on top of TCP or UDP, with standard default port designations Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. HTTP and HTTPS • Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol based on structured text with hyperlinks. • Most websites are built with HTTP. • HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP and uses TLS or SSL encryption to improve the privacy and security of the data transmitted and received. • HTTP defaults to port 80, HTTPS defaults to port 443. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. NetBIOS • NetBIOS or Network Basic Input/Output System is a networking API which runs on layer 4 (Session Layer) of the OSI model. • NetBIOS facilitates communication by assigning a NetBIOS name to a host and providing datagram and session services. • NetBIOS works on multiple underlying protocols, including its related protocol NetBeui, but today is most often run as NetBIOS over TCP/IP, using ports 137-139. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Internet Email • POP or Post-Office Protocol is used for the simplest form of Internet email delivery and defaults to port 110. • IMAP or Internet Message Access Protocol is a more advanced email protocol which allows a device to access email stored on a remote server. IMAP defaults to port 143. • SMTP or Simple Mail Transport Protocol is used to send email on the Internet, and defaults to port 25. Because port 25 is frequently blocked as a spam prevention measure, most SMTP servers also support alternate ports. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Audio/Video Protocols • SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), used for multimedia communication and VoIP phone systems, defaults to ports 5060 and 5061. • MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) is used in some VoIP applications and uses ports 2427 and 2727. • RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is used for streaming media such as video conferencing, and uses ports 5004/5005. • H.323 is a standard and a protocol used in voice and videoconferencing applications, and uses port 1720. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. TCP/IP Application Protocols • FTP, File Transfer Protocol (Ports 20 or 21) is used for sending files over TCP/IP networks. • TFTP, Trivial (or Tiny) File Transfer Protocol is a simplified version of FTP designed for very simple transfers such as firmware updates or configuration settings, and uses port 69. • SNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol is used to query or set attributes on network devices and uses port 161 by default. • Telnet is a protocol to allow access to remote computers and uses port 23. • SSH or Secure Shell functions similar to Telnet but with encryption and uses port 22. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. Microsoft Protocols • SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol for network file sharing on a Microsoft Windows network, and uses port 445. (A similar protocol, AFP or Apple Filing Protocol is used on Apple OSX networks). • RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is designed to share a user’s desktop, including the graphical interface, keyboard, mouse, and (in later versions) audio and print redirection. RDP uses port 3389 by default. Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. DNS and DHCP • DNS (Domain Name System) uses a unique protocol called the DNS protocol to facilitate assigning and looking up domain names. • The DNS protocol uses port 53. • DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) dynamically assigns network IP addresses, and uses ports 67 and 68 by default.

Summary • Port is a 16-bit number, representing a potential 65536 possible ports. • A Protocol is a standard for communication, with rules and conventions to facilitate communication between two devices. • Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol using port 80 which is based on structured text with hyperlinks. • SMTP or Simple Mail Transport Protocol is used to send email on the Internet, and defaults to port 25.
