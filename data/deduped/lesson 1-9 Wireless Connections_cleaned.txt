Wi-Fi Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Over 12 accepted 802.11 protocols exist, however the most common are: • 802.11a • 802.11b • 802.11g • 802.11n • 802.11ac • All use the 900MHz, 2.4GHz, and/or 5GHz frequency ranges, which are unregulated for public use in most countries. Wireless Connections Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Data signals are encoded into radio frequencies using modulation. • Common modulation techniques include: • DSSS: Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, used by 802.11b and 802.11g • OFDM: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing, used by 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac Modulation Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. 802.11a • 802.11a • Supports up to 54Mb/s • Uses the 5GHz band and OFDM multiplexing • Comparatively limited range due to signal absorption and interference Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • 802.11b • Supports up to 11Mb/s • Uses the 2.4GHz band and DSSS multiplexing • Longer range and lower cost compared to 802.11a • 802.11g • Supports up to 54Mb/s • Uses the 2.4GHz band and OFDM multiplexing • Backward compatible with 802.11b 802.11b and g Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Supports up to 600Mb/s • Uses the 2.4GHz OR 5GHz bands • Uses HT protection to coordinate signaling with legacy a, b, and g devices • Uses multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas to increase bandwidth 802.11n Copyright 2015, Simplilearn. All rights reserved. • Supports up to 1.3Gb/s • Uses 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands • Similar to 802.11n with enhancements • 160MHz channel bandwidth (compared to 40MHz in 802.11n, 20MHz in older standards) 802.11ac Copyright 2015, Simplilearn.
